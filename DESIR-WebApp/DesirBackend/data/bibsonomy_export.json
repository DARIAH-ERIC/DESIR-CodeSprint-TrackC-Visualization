Nevertheless, little is known about how much activity such systems actually cause over and above activity that would have occurred via other means (e.g., search) if recommendations were absent. Although the ideal way to estimate the causal impact of recommendations is via randomized experiments, such experiments are costly and may inconvenience users. In this paper, therefore, we present a method for estimating causal effects from purely observational data. Specifically, we show that causal identification through an instrumental variable is possible when a product experiences an instantaneous shock in direct traffic and the products recommended next to it do not. We then apply our method to browsing logs containing anonymized activity for 2.1 million users on Amazon.com over a 9 month period and analyze over 4,000 unique products that experience such shocks. We find that although recommendation click-throughs do account for a large fraction of traffic among these products, at least 75% of this activity would likely occur in the absence of recommendations. We conclude with a discussion about the assumptions under which the method is appropriate and caveats around extrapolating results to other products, sites, or settings.",

                    "bibtexAbstract": "In the last 16 years, more than 200 research articles were published about research-paper recommender systems. We reviewed these articles and present some descriptive statistics in this paper, as well as a discussion about the major advancements and shortcomings and an overview of the most common recommendation concepts and approaches. We found that more than half of the recommendation approaches applied content-based filtering (55 {\\%}). Collaborative filtering was applied by only 18 {\\%} of the reviewed approaches, and graph-based recommendations by 16 {\\%}. Other recommendation concepts included stereotyping, item-centric recommendations, and hybrid recommendations. The content-based filtering approaches mainly utilized papers that the users had authored, tagged, browsed, or downloaded. TF-IDF was the most frequently applied weighting scheme. In addition to simple terms, n-grams, topics, and citations were utilized to model users' information needs. Our review revealed some shortcomings of the current research. First, it remains unclear which recommendation concepts and approaches are the most promising. For instance, researchers reported different results on the performance of content-based and collaborative filtering. Sometimes content-based filtering performed better than collaborative filtering and sometimes it performed worse. We identified three potential reasons for the ambiguity of the results. (A) Several evaluations had limitations. They were based on strongly pruned datasets, few participants in user studies, or did not use appropriate baselines. (B) Some authors provided little information about their algorithms, which makes it difficult to re-implement the approaches. Consequently, researchers use different implementations of the same recommendations approaches, which might lead to variations in the results. (C) We speculated that minor variations in datasets, algorithms, or user populations inevitably lead to strong variations in the performance of the approaches. Hence, finding the most promising approaches is a challenge. As a second limitation, we noted that many authors neglected to take into account factors other than accuracy, for example overall user satisfaction. In addition, most approaches (81 {\\%}) neglected the user-modeling process and did not infer information automatically but let users provide keywords, text snippets, or a single paper as input. Information on runtime was provided for 10 {\\%} of the approaches. Finally, few research papers had an impact on research-paper recommender systems in practice. We also identified a lack of authority and long-term research interest in the field: 73 {\\%} of the authors published no more than one paper on research-paper recommender systems, and there was little cooperation among different co-author groups. We concluded that several actions could improve the research landscape: developing a common evaluation framework, agreement on the information to include in research papers, a stronger focus on non-accuracy aspects and user modeling, a platform for researchers to exchange information, and an open-source framework that bundles the available recommendation approaches.",

Prominent examples of these services are online recommender systems and consumer feedback mechanisms, both of which serve to reduce consumer search costs and uncertainty associated with the purchase of unfamiliar products. The central question we address is how recommender systems affect sales. We take into consideration the interaction among recommendations, sales, and price. We then develop a robust empirical model that incorporates the indirect effect of recommendations on sales through retailer pricing, potential simultaneity between sales and recommendations, and a comprehensive measure of the strength of recommendations. Applying the model to a panel data set collected from two online retailers, we found that the strength of recommendations has a positive effect on sales. Moreover, this effect is moderated by the recency effect, where more recently released recommended items positively affect the cross-selling efforts of sellers. We also show that recommender systems help to reinforce the long-tail phenomenon of electronic commerce, and obscure recommendations positively affect cross-selling. We also found a positive effect of recommendations on prices. These results suggest that recommendations not only improve sales but they also provide added flexibility to retailers to adjust their prices. A comparative analysis reveals that recommendations have a higher effect on sales than does consumer feedback. Our empirical results show that providing value-added services, such as digital word of mouth and recommendations, allows retailers to charge higher prices while at the same time increasing demand by providing more information regarding the quality and match of products.

Given the prevalence of recommender systems on the wider web, especially in e‐commerce environments, this paper aims to review current research in this area that is of particular relevance to the library community. It attempts to gauge the uptake of recommender systems in exiting OPAC services, and identify issues that might be responsible for inhibiting wider uptake.\r\n\r\n    Design/methodology/approach\r\n    – This paper draws on an extensive literature review, as well as original research comparing the functionality of 211 public and 118 university library OPACs in the UK. Examining current recommender systems research, it outlines the most significant recommendation models and reviews research in two key areas of recommender systems design: data acquisition, and the explanation of recommendations. It discusses three existing library recommendation systems: BibTip, LibraryThing for Libraries and the in‐house system at the University of Huddersfield.\r\n\r\n    Findings\r\n    – The authors' analysis indicates that the incorporation of recommender systems into library services is extremely low, with only 2 per cent of public libraries and 11 per cent of university libraries in the UK offering the feature. While system limitations and budget constraints are perhaps partly to blame, it is suggested that library professionals have perhaps yet to be persuaded that the value of recommendations to library users is great enough to warrant their inclusion becoming a priority.\r\n\r\n    Originality/value\r\n    – This paper represents the first study of UK library OPACs to focus on the prevalence of recommender systems.",

It highlights two of the key issues facing recommender systems design in the library domain: 1) Trust: users' trust both in the system itself and in collaboratively generated suggestions; and 2) Context: the difficulties of a system adapting to the huge range of information-seeking contexts that accompany a diverse user base. The paper describes how future qualitative and quantitative research will attempt to address these issues, and produce a system that best serves users of WorldCat.org.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that as well as contributing to recommender systems research in general, the results of this project will help inform debates relating to the interaction between users and systems in a library context.",

A predominant approach to collaborative filtering is neighborhood based (\" k-nearest neighbors\"), where a user-item preference rating is interpolated from ratings of similar items and/or users. We enhance the neighborhood-based approach leading to substantial improvement of prediction accuracy, without a meaningful increase in running time. First, we remove certain so-called \"global effects\" from the data to make the ratings more comparable, thereby improving interpolation accuracy. Second, we show how to simultaneously derive interpolation weights for all nearest neighbors, unlike previous approaches where each weight is computed separately. By globally solving a suitable optimization problem, this simultaneous interpolation accounts for the many interactions between neighbors leading to improved accuracy. Our method is very fast in practice, generating a prediction in about 0.2 milliseconds. Importantly, it does not require training many parameters or a lengthy preprocessing, making it very practical for large scale applications. Finally, we show how to apply these methods to the perceivably much slower user-oriented approach. To this end, we suggest a novel scheme for low dimensional embedding of the users. We evaluate these methods on the Netflix dataset, where they deliver significantly better results than the commercial Netflix Cinematch recommender system.",

For academic literature, research has proven the ability of citation-based document similarity measures, such as Co-Citation (CoCit), or Co-Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA) to improve recommendation quality. In this paper, we report on the first large-scale investigation of the performance of the CPA approach in generating literature recommendations for Wikipedia, which is fundamentally different from the academic literature domain. We analyze links instead of citations to generate article recommendations. We evaluate CPA, CoCit, and the Apache Lucene MoreLikeThis (MLT) function, which represents a traditional text-based similarity measure. We use two datasets of 779,716 and 2.57 million Wikipedia articles, the Big Data processing framework Apache Flink, and a ten-node computing cluster. To enable our large-scale evaluation, we derive two quasi-gold standards from the links in Wikipedia's \"See also\" sections and a comprehensive Wikipedia clickstream dataset. Our results show that the citation-based measures CPA and CoCit have complementary strengths compared to the text-based MLT measure. While MLT performs well in identifying narrowly similar articles that share similar words and structure, the citation- based measures are better able to identify topically related information, such as information on the city of a certain university or other technical universities in the region. The CPA approach, which consistently outperformed CoCit, is better suited for identifying a broader spectrum of related articles, as well as popular articles that typically exhibit a higher quality. Additional benefits of the CPA approach are its lower runtime requirements and its language-independence that allows for a cross-language retrieval of articles. We present a manual analysis of exemplary articles to demonstrate and discuss our findings.

From an economic perspective, the latter approach has been convincing as calculating frequencies is computationally efficient and has shown to be effective with respect to different recommender evaluation metrics. In order to extend these conventional “most popular tags” approaches we introduce a tag recommendation algorithm that mimics the way humans draw on items in their long-term memory. Based on a theory of human memory, the approach estimates a tag’s reuse probability as a function of usage frequency and recency in the user’s past (base-level activation) as well as of the current semantic context (associative component). Using four real-world folksonomies gathered from bookmarks in BibSonomy, CiteULike, Delicious and Flickr, we show how refining frequency-based estimates, by considering recency and semantic context, outperforms conventional “most popular tags” approaches and another existing and very effective but less theory-driven, time-dependent recommendation mechanism. By combining our approach with a resource-specific frequency analysis, our algorithm outperforms other well-established algorithms, such as Collaborative Filtering, FolkRank and Pairwise Interaction Tensor Factorization with respect to recommender accuracy and runtime. We conclude that our approach provides an accurate and computationally efficient model of a user’s temporal tagging behavior. Moreover, we demonstrate how effective principles of recommender systems can be designed and implemented if human memory processes are taken into account.",

Such systems have become increasingly popular in entertainment and e-commerce domains, but have thus far had little success in information-seeking domains such as identifying published research of interest. We report on several recent publications that show how recommenders can be extended to more effectively address information-seeking tasks by expanding the focus from accurate prediction of user preferences to identifying a useful set of items to recommend in response to the user's specific information need. Specific research demonstrates the value of diversity in recommendation lists, shows how users value lists of recommendations as something different from the sum of the individual recommendations within, and presents an analytic model for customizing a recommender to match user information-seeking needs.",

These algorithms typically perform differently in various domains and tasks. Therefore, it is important from the research perspective, as well as from a practical view, to be able to decide on an algorithm that matches the domain and the task of interest. The standard way to make such decisions is by comparing a number of algorithms offline using some evaluation metric. Indeed, many evaluation metrics have been suggested for comparing recommendation algorithms. The decision on the proper evaluation metric is often critical, as each metric may favor a different algorithm. In this paper we review the proper construction of offline experiments for deciding on the most appropriate algorithm. We discuss three important tasks of recommender systems, and classify a set of appropriate well known evaluation metrics for each task. We demonstrate how using an improper evaluation metric can lead to the selection of an improper algorithm for the task of interest. We also discuss other important considerations when designing offline experiments.",

The automatically added metadata on these scanned documents, are not sufficient to make a specific search. User effort is needed to add manual annotations in order to enhance document content accessibility and exploitability. Annotators have different experiences in dissimilar manuscript domains. Hence the reuse of users’ experiences is constructive to accelerate the annotation process and to correct user mistakes. In this article we present our digital archive model and a prototype to collaboratively annotate online ancient manuscripts. Our system tracks important user actions, and saves them as traces composed of hierarchical episodes. These episodes are considered as cases to be reused by a recommender system.",

These data are large user/item\r\nmatrices where each user has provided feedback on only a small subset of items,\r\neither explicitly (e.g., through star ratings) or implicitly (e.g., through\r\nviews or purchases). In contrast to traditional matrix factorization\r\napproaches, Poisson factorization implicitly models each user's limited\r\nattention to consume items. Moreover, because of the mathematical form of the\r\nPoisson likelihood, the model needs only to explicitly consider the observed\r\nentries in the matrix, leading to both scalable computation and good predictive\r\nperformance. We develop a variational inference algorithm for approximate\r\nposterior inference that scales up to massive data sets. This is an efficient\r\nalgorithm that iterates over the observed entries and adjusts an approximate\r\nposterior over the user/item representations. We apply our method to large\r\nreal-world user data containing users rating movies, users listening to songs,\r\nand users reading scientific papers. In all these settings, Bayesian Poisson\r\nfactorization outperforms state-of-the-art matrix factorization methods.",

In such systems, tag recommender systems support users during the posting of a resource by suggesting suitable tags. Tag recommender algorithms have often been evaluated in offline benchmarking experiments. Yet, the particular setup of such experiments has rarely been analyzed. In particular, since the recommendation quality usually suffers from difficulties like the sparsity of the data or the cold start problem for new resources or users, datasets have often been pruned to so-called cores (specific subsets of the original datasets) – however without much consideration of the implications on the benchmarking results. \r\nIn this paper, we generalize the notion of a core by introducing the new notion of a set-core – which is independent of any graph structure – to overcome a structural drawback in the previous constructions of cores on tagging data. We show that problems caused by some types of cores can be eliminated using set-cores. Further, we present a thorough analysis of tag recommender benchmarking setups using cores. To that end, we conduct a large-scale experiment on four real-world datasets in which we analyze the influence of different cores on the evaluation of recommendation algorithms. We can show that the results of the comparison of different recommendation approaches depends on the selection of core type and level. For the benchmarking of tag recommender algorithms, our results suggest that the evaluation must be set up more carefully and should not be based on one arbitrarily chosen core type and level",

We focus on three groups of data characteristics: rating space, rating frequency distribution, and rating value distribution. A sampling procedure was employed to obtain different rating data subsamples with varying characteristics; recommendation algorithms were used to estimate the predictive accuracy for each sample; and linear regression-based models were used to uncover the relationships between data characteristics and recommendation accuracy. Experimental results on multiple rating datasets show the consistent and significant effects of several data characteristics on recommendation accuracy.",

A new democratic vision emerged, in which users can actively contribute to the evolution of the Web by producing new content or enriching the existing one with user generated metadata. In this context the use of tags, keywords freely chosen by users for describing and organizing resources, spread as a model for browsing and retrieving web contents. The success of that collaborative model is justified by two factors: firstly, information is organized in a way that closely reflects the users’ mental model; secondly, the absence of a controlled vocabulary reduces the users’ learning curve and allows the use of evolving vocabularies. Since tags are handled in a purely syntactical way, annotations provided by users generate a very sparse and noisy tag space that limits the effectiveness for complex tasks. Consequently, tag recommenders, with their ability of providing users with the most suitable tags for the resources to be annotated, recently emerged as a way of speeding up the process of tag convergence. The contribution of this work is a tag recommender system implementing both a collaborative and a content-based recommendation technique. The former exploits the user and community tagging behavior for producing recommendations, while the latter exploits some heuristics to extract tags directly from the textual content of resources. Results of experiments carried out on a dataset gathered from Bibsonomy show that hybrid recommendation strategies can outperform single ones and the way of combining them matters for obtaining more accurate results.",

In this paper, we present an elegant and effective framework for combining content and collaboration. Our approach uses a content-based predictor tc enhance existing user data, and then provides personalized suggestions through collaborative filtering.

                    "bibtexAbstract": "Exploiting temporal context has been proved to be an effective approach to improve recommendation performance, as shown, e.g. in the Netflix Prize competition. Time-aware recommender systems (TARS) are indeed receiving increasing attention. A wide range of approaches dealing with the time dimension in user modeling and recommendation strategies have been proposed. In the literature, however, reported results and conclusions about how to incorporate and exploit time information within the recommendation processes seem to be contradictory in some cases. Aiming to clarify and address existing discrepancies, in this paper we present a comprehensive survey and analysis of the state of the art on TARS. The analysis show that meaningful divergences appear in the evaluation protocols used—metrics and methodologies. We identify a number of key conditions on offline evaluation of TARS, and based on these conditions, we provide a comprehensive classification of evaluation protocols for TARS. Moreover, we propose a methodological description framework aimed to make the evaluation process fair and reproducible. We also present an empirical study on the impact of different evaluation protocols on measuring relative performances of well-known TARS. The results obtained show that different uses of the above evaluation conditions yield to remarkably distinct performance and relative ranking values of the recommendation approaches. They reveal the need of clearly stating the evaluation conditions used to ensure comparability and reproducibility of reported results. From our analysis and experiments, we finally conclude with methodological issues a robust evaluation of TARS should take into consideration. Furthermore we provide a number of general guidelines to select proper conditions for evaluating particular TARS.",

Researchers need tools to help them find the papers they should read among all the papers published each year. In this paper, we present and experiment with hybrid recommender algorithms that combine Collaborative Filtering and Content-based. Filtering to recommend research papers to users. Our hybrid algorithms combine the strengths of each filtering approach to address their individual weaknesses. We evaluated our algorithms through offline experiments on a database of 102, 000 research papers, and through an online experiment with 110 users. For both experiments we used a dataset created from the CiteSeer repository of computer science research papers. We developed separate English and Portuguese versions of the interface and specifically recruited American and Brazilian users to test for cross-cultural effects. Our results show that users value paper recommendations, that the hybrid algorithms can be successfully combined, that different algorithms are more suitable for recommending different kinds of papers, and that users with different levels of experience perceive recommendations differently These results can be applied to develop recommender systems for other types of digital libraries.",

                    "bibtexAbstract": "Recommender systems usually provide explanations of their recommendations to better help users to choose products, activities or even friends. Up until now, the type of an explanation style was considered in accordance to the recommender system that employed it. This relation was one-to-one, meaning that for each different recommender systems category, there was a different explanation style category. However, this kind of one-to-one correspondence can be considered as over-simplistic and non generalizable. In contrast, we consider three fundamental resources that can be used in an explanation: users, items and features and any combination of them. In this survey, we define (i) the Human style of explanation, which provides explanations based on similar users, (ii) the Item style of explanation, which is based on choices made by a user on similar items and (iii) the Feature style of explanation, which explains the recommendation based on item features rated by the user beforehand. By using any combination of the aforementioned styles we can also define the Hybrid style of explanation. We demonstrate how these styles are put into practice, by presenting recommender systems that employ them. Moreover, since there is inadequate research in the impact of social web in contemporary recommender systems and their explanation styles, we study new emerged social recommender systems i.e. Facebook Connect explanations (HuffPo, Netflix, etc.) and geo-social explanations that combine geographical with social data (Gowalla, Facebook Places, etc.). Finally, we summarize the results of three different user studies, to support that Hybrid is the most effective explanation style, since it incorporates all other styles.",

Following a brief review of existing approaches to explanation in recommender systems, we focus in this paper on a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach to product recommendation that offers important benefits in terms of the ease with which the recommendation process can be explained and the system’s recommendations can be justified. For example, recommendations based on incomplete queries can be justified on the grounds that the user’s preferences with respect to attributes not mentioned in her query cannot affect the outcome. We also show how the relevance of any question the user is asked can be explained in terms of its ability to discriminate between competing cases, thus giving users a unique insight into the recommendation process.",

Scienstein improves the approach of the usually used keyword-based search by combining it with citation analysis, author analysis, source analysis, implicit ratings, explicit ratings and in addition, innovative and yet unused methods like the ‘Distance Similarity Index’ (DSI) and the ‘In-text Impact Factor’ (ItIF). Instead of entering just keywords, a user may provide entire documents, including reference lists as input and make implicit and explicit ratings to improve recommendations. With citation, author and source analysis, similar and related documents are easily determinable. All these techniques are managed by a user-friendly GUI.\r\n",

The TFC model consists of three distinctive steps, in each of which important innovative elements are proposed. More specifically, through its first step, the content information is exploited to propagate tags between conceptual similar items based on a relevance feedback mechanism, in order to solve sparsity and &#x201C;cold start&#x201D; problems. Through its second step, sparsity is further handled, by generating tag clusters and revealing topics, following an innovative <i>tf</i> &#x00B7;<i>idf</i> weighting scheme. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that a few number of expert tags can improve the performance of quality recommendations, since they contribute to more coherent tag clusters. Through its third step, the latent associations among users, topics, and items are revealed by exploiting the TF technique of high order singular value decomposition. This way the proposed TFC model tackles problems of real-world applications, which produce noise and decrease the quality of recommendations. In our experiments with real-world social data, we show that the proposed TFC model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, which also exploit the TF technique of HOSVD.",

This thriving subfield of machine learning became popular in the late 1990s with the spread of online services that use recommender systems, such as Amazon, Yahoo! Music, and Netflix. CF approaches are usually designed to work on very large data sets. Therefore the scalability of the methods is crucial. In this work, we propose various scalable solutions that are validated against the Netflix Prize data set, currently the largest publicly available collection. First, we propose various matrix factorization (MF) based techniques. Second, a neighbor correction method for MF is outlined, which alloys the global perspective of MF and the localized property of neighbor based approaches efficiently. In the experimentation section, we first report on some implementation issues, and we suggest on how parameter optimization can be performed efficiently for MFs. We then show that the proposed scalable approaches compare favorably with existing ones in terms of prediction accuracy and/or required training time. Finally, we report on some experiments performed on MovieLens and Jester data sets.",

Each of these techniques has its own strengths and weaknesses. In search of better performance, researchers have combined recommendation techniques to build hybrid recommender systems. This chapter surveys the space of two-part hybrid recommender systems, comparing four different recommendation techniques and seven different hybridization strategies. Implementations of 41 hybrids including some novel combinations are examined and compared. The study finds that cascade and augmented hybrids work well, especially when combining two components of differing strengths.",

                    "bibtexAbstract": "In many commercial systems, the 'best bet' recommendations are shown, but the predicted rating values are not. This is usually referred to as a top-N recommendation task, where the goal of the recommender system is to find a few specific items which are supposed to be most appealing to the user. Common methodologies based on error metrics (such as RMSE) are not a natural fit for evaluating the top-N recommendation task. Rather, top-N performance can be directly measured by alternative methodologies based on accuracy metrics (such as precision/recall). An extensive evaluation of several state-of-the art recommender algorithms suggests that algorithms optimized for minimizing RMSE do not necessarily perform as expected in terms of top-N recommendation task. Results show that improvements in RMSE often do not translate into accuracy improvements. In particular, a naive non-personalized algorithm can outperform some common recommendation approaches and almost match the accuracy of sophisticated algorithms. Another finding is that the very few top popular items can skew the top-N performance. The analysis points out that when evaluating a recommender algorithm on the top-N recommendation task, the test set should be chosen carefully in order to not bias accuracy metrics towards non-personalized solutions. Finally, we offer practitioners new variants of two collaborative filtering algorithms that, regardless of their RMSE, significantly outperform other recommender algorithms in pursuing the top-N recommendation task, with offering additional practical advantages. This comes at surprise given the simplicity of these two methods.",

While a substantial amount of research has already been performed in the area of recommender systems, most existing approaches focus on recommending the most relevant items to users without taking into account any additional contextual information, such as time, location, or the company of other people (e.g., for watching movies or dining out). In this chapter we argue that relevant contextual information does matter in recommender systems and that it is important to take this information into account when providing recommendations. We discuss the general notion of context and how it can be modeled in recommender systems. Furthermore, we introduce three different algorithmic paradigms – contextual prefiltering, post-filtering, and modeling – for incorporating contextual information into the recommendation process, discuss the possibilities of combining several contextaware recommendation techniques into a single unifying approach, and provide a case study of one such combined approach. Finally, we present additional capabilities for context-aware recommenders and discuss important and promising directions for future research.",

Our two experimental systems, Quickstep and Foxtrot, create user profiles from unobtrusively monitored behaviour and relevance feedback, representing the profiles in terms of a research paper topic ontology. A novel profile visualization approach is taken to acquire profile feedback. Research papers are classified using ontological classes and collaborative recommendation algorithms used to recommend papers seen by similar people on their current topics of interest. Two small-scale experiments, with 24 subjects over 3 months, and a large-scale experiment, with 260 subjects over an academic year, are conducted to evaluate different aspects of our approach. Ontological inference is shown to improve user profiling, external ontological knowledge used to successfully bootstrap a recommender system and profile visualization employed to improve profiling accuracy. The overall performance of our ontological recommender systems are also presented and favourably compared to other systems in the literature.",

Such systems could significantly reduce the search and evaluation costs of information products for students and scientists. This holds for pure digital libraries as well as for traditional scientific libraries with online public access catalogs (OPAC). In this contribution we first outline different types of recommendation services for scientific libraries and their general integration strategies. Then we focus on a recommender system based on log file analysis that is fully operational within the legacy library system of the Universität Karlsruhe (TH) since June 2002. Its underlying mathematical model, the implementation within the OPAC, as well as the first user evaluation is presented.",

Social networks provide one means of visualizing existing and potential interaction in organizational settings. Groupware designers are using social networks to make systems more sensitive to social situations and guide users toward effective collaborations. Yet, the implications of embedding social networks in systems have not been systematically studied. This paper details an evaluation of two different social networks used in a system to recommend individuals for possible collaboration. The system matches people looking for expertise with individuals likely to have expertise. The effectiveness of social networks for matching individuals is evaluated and compared. One finding is that social networks embedded into systems do not match individuals' perceptions of their personal social network. This finding and others raise issues for the use of social networks in groupware. Based on the evaluation results, several design considerations are discussed.",

Given a broader interpretation of “recommending” than is commonly accepted, such a preference ordering may be viewed as a recommendation, made by the system to the information seeker, that is itself typically derived through synthesis of multiple preference orderings expressed as recommendations by indexers, information seekers, and document authors. The ERIn (Evaluation–Recommendation–Information) model, a decision-theoretic framework for understanding information-related activity, highlights the centrality of recommending in the document retrieval process, and may be used to clarify the respects in which indexing, rating, and citation may be considered analogous, as well as to make explicit the points at which content-based, collaboration-based, and context-based flavors of document retrieval systems vary.",

While most existing recommender systems rely either on a content-based approach or a collaborative approach to make recommendations, there is potential to improve recommendation quality by using a combination of both approaches (a hybrid approach). In this paper, we report how we tested the idea of using a graph-based recommender system that naturally combines the content-based and collaborative approaches. Due to the similarity between our problem and a concept retrieval task, a Hopfield net algorithm was used to exploit high-degree book-book, user-user and book-user associations. Sample hold-out testing and preliminary subject testing were conducted to evaluate the system, by which it was found that the system gained improvement with respect to both precision and recall by combining content-based and collaborative approaches. However, no significant improvement was observed by exploiting high-degree associations.",

                    "bibtexAbstract": "In order to build relevant, useful, and effective recommender systems, researchers need to understand why users come to these systems and how users judge recommendation lists. Today, researchers use accuracy-based metrics for judging goodness. Yet these metrics cannot capture users' criteria for judging recommendation usefulness. We need to rethink recommenders from a user's perspective: they help users find new information. Thus, not only do we need to know about the user, we need to know what the user is looking for. In this dissertation, we explore how to tailor recommendation lists not just to a user, but to the user's current information seeking task. We argue that each recommender algorithm has specific strengths and weaknesses, different from other algorithms. Thus, different recommender algorithms are better suited for specific users and their information seeking tasks. A recommender system should, then, select and tune the appropriate recommender algorithm (or algorithms) for a given user/information seeking task combination. To support this, we present results in three areas. First, we apply recommender systems in the domain of peer-reviewed computer science research papers, a domain where users have external criteria for selecting items to consume. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through several sets of experiments. Second, we argue that current recommender systems research in not focused on user needs, but rather on algorithm design and performance. To bring users back into focus, we reflect on how users perceive recommenders and the recommendation process, and present Human-Recommender Interaction theory, a framework and language for describing recommenders and the recommendation lists they generate. Third, we look to different ways of evaluating recommender systems algorithms. To this end, we propose a new set of recommender metrics, run experiments on several recommender algorithms using these metrics, and categorize the differences we discovered. Through Human-Recommender Interaction and these new metrics, we can bridge users and their needs with recommender algorithms to generate more useful recommendation lists.",

In the past this task is usually performed manually or by using links information of papers. Link information only used title of paper and ignored the semantic-based text information present in the paper contents. Due to overlaps between different fields e.g. in computer science only title of a paper cannot be real representative of different other hidden topics of that paper. We think it is necessary to model the semantic information present in papers to provide more appropriate citations by capturing hidden topics. In this paper, we address this issue by modeling citations on the basis of latent topics present in the papers. Latent topics can provide us semantic correlations present between the papers. We propose a topic modeling approach in which each citation of a paper is represented as a probability distribution over latent topics, and each latent topic is represented as a probability distribution over words of paper for that topic, which can provide us more appropriate citations for a given paper. Experimental results on citeceer corpus shows the effectiveness of proposed approach and detailed interpretation of results reveals interesting information about scientific\r\nrecommendation.\r\n",

Recommender systems have taken a huge leap towards this goal, significantly improving the user experience in the online environment. There are two main approaches, content-based and collaborative filtering, both with advantages and drawbacks. We propose an article recommender system that integrates content based, collaborative and metadata recommendations, allowing users to select the method that best suits their needs. The first approach uses keywords in order to find similar articles, given a query or an entire document. Collaborative filtering is implemented using a P2P network in which data is distributed evenly across all peers. The last technique uses data from a semantic repository containing information about articles (e.g. title, author, domain), which can be interrogated using natural language-like queries. In addition, we present in detail the results obtained from employing the P2P network in terms of providing timely responses to the collaborative filtering technique and of ensuring reliability through data replication.",

As such a good citation recommendation system would not only improve our paper but, overall, the efficiency and quality of literature search. Usually, a citation's context contains explicit words explaining the citation. Using this, we propose a method that \"translates\" research papers into references. By considering the citations and their contexts from existing papers as parallel data written in two different \"languages\", we adopt the translation model to create a relationship between these two \"vocabularies\". Experiments on both CiteSeer and CiteULike dataset show that our approach outperforms other baseline methods and increase the precision, recall and f-measure by at least 5% to 10%, respectively. In addition, our approach runs much faster in the both training and recommending stage, which proves the effectiveness and the scalability of our work.",

One approach to this problem is to use recommender systems that identify user interests through various methods in order to provide information specific to the user's needs. However, many current recommender systems use a collaborative model based on a network of users to provide the recommendations, leading to problems in environments where network relationships are sparse or unknown. Content-based recommenders can avoid the sparsity problem but they may be inefficient for large document collections. In this paper, we propose a concept-based recommender system that recommends papers to general users of the CiteSeerx digital library of Computer Science research publications. We also represent a novel way of classifying documents and creating user profiles based on the ACM (Association for Computer Machinery) classification tree. Based on these user profiles which are built using past click histories, relevant papers in the domain are recommended to users. Experiments with a set of users on the CiteSeerX database show that our concept-based method provides accurate recommendations even with limited user profile histories.",

There are many potential pitfalls, including not knowing what tasks to support, generating recommendations for the wrong task, or even failing to generate any meaningful recommendations whatsoever. We posit that different recommender algorithms are better suited to certain information seeking tasks. In this work, we perform a detailed user study with over 130 users to understand these differences between recommender algorithms through an online survey of paper recommendations from the ACM Digital Library. We found that pitfalls are hard to avoid. Two of our algorithms generated 'atypical' recommendations recommendations that were unrelated to their input baskets. Users reacted accordingly, providing strong negative results for these algorithms. Results from our 'typical' algorithms show some qualitative differences, but since users were exposed to two algorithms, the results may be biased. We present a wide variety of results, teasing out differences between algorithms. Finally, we succinctly summarize our most striking results as \"Don't Look Stupid\" in front of users.",

The approaches were introduced and evaluated in more than 170 research articles, as well as patents, presentations and blogs. We reviewed these approaches and found most evaluations to contain major shortcomings. Of the approaches proposed, 21% were not evaluated. Among the evaluated approaches, 19% were not evaluated against a baseline. Of the user studies performed, 60% had 15 or fewer participants or did not report on the number of participants. Information on runtime and coverage was rarely provided. Due to these and several other shortcomings described in this paper, we conclude that it is currently not possible to determine which recommendation approaches for academic literature are the most promising. However, there is little value in the existence of more than 80 approaches if the best performing approaches are unknown.\r\n",

In this paper, we propose a recommender system that recommends research papers of potential interest to authors known to the CiteSeer database. For each author participating in the study, we create a user profile based on their previously published papers. Based on similarities between the user profile and profiles for documents in the collection, additional papers are recommended to the author. We introduce a novel way of representing the user profiles as trees of concepts and an algorithm for computing the similarity between the user profiles and document profiles using a tree-edit distance measure.

For instance, consider a recommendation service through which researchers can receive daily pointers to journal papers in their fields of interest. We survey some of the known approaches to the problem of technical paper recommendation and ask how they can be extended to deal with multiple information sources. More specifically, we focus on a variant of this problem - recommending conference paper submissions to reviewing committee members - which offers us a testbed to try different approaches. Using WHIRL - an information integration system - we are able to implement different recommendation algorithms derived from information retrieval principles. We also use a novel autonomous procedure for gathering reviewer interest information from the Web. We evaluate our approach and compare it to other methods using preference data provided by members of the AAAI-98 conference reviewing committee along with data about the actual submissions.",

They allow users to create tags that annotate and categorize content and share them with other users, very helpful in particular for searching multimedia content. However, as tagging is not constrained by a controlled vocabulary and annotation guidelines, tags tend to be noisy and sparse. Especially new resources annotated by only a few users have often rather idiosyncratic tags that do not reflect a common perspective useful for search. In this paper we introduce an approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for recommending tags of resources in order to improve search. Resources annotated by many users and thus equipped with a fairly stable and complete tag set are used to elicit latent topics to which new resources with only a few tags are mapped. Based on this, other tags belonging to a topic can be recommended for the new resource. Our evaluation shows that the approach achieves significantly better precision and recall than the use of association rules, suggested in previous work, and also recommends more specific tags. Moreover, extending resources with these recommended tags significantly improves search for new resources.",

Recommender systems implement media personalization, by suggesting relevant content and helping users in addressing the “information overload” problem. In this paper, our aim is to improve personalization by increasing the accuracy of recommendations. We propose a novel method, called Content Relationships Matrix Factorization (CRMF), which exploits additional information in the form of content relationships that express relevance between items. We model content relationships based on affinity graphs and use them in the context of matrix-factorization, which are currently the state-of-the-art prediction models for recommender systems. In our experimental evaluation with a real data set, we demonstrate the accuracy improvement of CRMF compared to matrix factorization models that do not take into account content relationships. Our experimental results show that CRMF compares favorably to the baseline method, demonstrating the usefulness of considering content relationships.",

We also explore three data fusion techniques to make more powerful hybrid tag recommenders using TagRank, two collaborative filtering based algorithms and three tag popularity based algorithms. In order to find appropriate individual recommenders to make hybrid, we propose a greedy selection algorithm.

Even though existing work has suggested a wide range of criteria, the consistency and validity of the combined criteria have not been tested. In this paper, we describe a unifying evaluation framework, called ResQue (Recommender systems' Quality of user experience), which aimed at measuring the qualities of the recommended items, the system's usability, usefulness, interface and interaction qualities, users' satisfaction with the systems, and the influence of these qualities on users' behavioral intentions, including their intention to purchase the products recommended to them and return to the system. We also show the results of applying psychometric methods to validate the combined criteria using data collected from a large user survey. The outcomes of the validation are able to 1) support the consistency, validity and reliability of the selected criteria; and 2) explain the quality of user experience and the key determinants motivating users to adopt the recommender technology. The final model consists of thirty two questions and fifteen constructs, defining the essential qualities of an effective and satisfying recommender system, as well as providing practitioners and scholars with a cost-effective way to evaluate the success of a recommender system and identify important areas in which to invest development resources.",

                    "bibtexAbstract": "Recommender systems are now popular both commercially and in the research community, where many approaches have been suggested for providing recommendations. In many cases a system designer that wishes to employ a recommendation system must choose between a set of candidate approaches. A first step towards selecting an appropriate algorithm is to decide which properties of the application to focus upon when making this choice. Indeed, recommendation systems have a variety of properties that may affect user experience, such as accuracy, robustness, scalability, and so forth. In this paper we discuss how to compare recommenders based on a set of properties that are relevant for the application. We focus on comparative studies, where a few algorithms are compared using some evaluation metric, rather than absolute benchmarking of algorithms. We describe experimental settings appropriate for making choices between algorithms. We review three types of experiments, starting with an offline setting, where recommendation approaches are compared without user interaction, then reviewing user studies, where a small group of subjects experiment with the system and report on the experience, and finally describe large scale online experiments, where real user populations interact with the system. In each of these cases we describe types of questions that can be answered, and suggest protocols for experimentation. We also discuss how to draw trustworthy conclusions from the conducted experiments. We then review a large set of properties, and explain how to evaluate systems given relevant properties. We also survey a large set of evaluation metrics in the context of the property that they evaluate.\r\n",

These techniques involve off-line analysis using evaluation methods from machine learning and information retrieval. We argue that while off-line analysis is useful, user satisfaction with a recommendation strategy can only be measured in an on-line context. We propose a new evaluation framework which involves a paired test of two recommender systems which simultaneously compete to give the best recommendations to the same user at the same time. The user interface and the interaction model for each system is the same. The framework enables you to specify an API so that different recommendation strategies may take part in such a competition. The API defines issues such as access to data, the interaction model and the means of gathering positive feedback from the user. In this way it is possible to obtain a relative measure of user satisfaction with the two systems.",

These systems often rely on Collaborating Filtering (CF), where past transactions are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and products. The two more successful approaches to CF are latent factor models, which directly profile both users and products, and neighborhood models, which analyze similarities between products or users. In this work we introduce some innovations to both approaches. The factor and neighborhood models can now be smoothly merged, thereby building a more accurate combined model. Further accuracy improvements are achieved by extending the models to exploit both explicit and implicit feedback by the users. The methods are tested on the Netflix data. Results are better than those previously published on that dataset. In addition, we suggest a new evaluation metric, which highlights the differences among methods, based on their performance at a top-K recommendation task.",

Context-aware recommenders take this information into account to make predictions. So far, the best performing method for context-aware rating prediction in terms of predictive accuracy is Multiverse Recommendation based on the Tucker tensor factorization model. However this method has two drawbacks: (1) its model complexity is exponential in the number of context variables and polynomial in the size of the factorization and (2) it only works for categorical context variables. On the other hand there is a large variety of fast but specialized recommender methods which lack the generality of context-aware methods. We propose to apply Factorization Machines (FMs) to model contextual information and to provide context-aware rating predictions. This approach results in fast context-aware recommendations because the model equation of FMs can be computed in linear time both in the number of context variables and the factorization size. For learning FMs, we develop an iterative optimization method that analytically finds the least-square solution for one parameter given the other ones. Finally, we show empirically that our approach outperforms Multiverse Recommendation in prediction quality and runtime.",

However, the (offline) evaluation of tag recommendation algorithms usually suffers from difficulties like the sparseness of the data or the cold start problem for new resources or users. Previous studies therefore often used so-called post-cores (specific subsets of the original datasets) for their experiments. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale experiment in which we analyze different tag recommendation algorithms on different cores of three real-world datasets. We show, that a recommender's performance depends on the particular core and explore correlations between performances on different cores.",

With a population of more than 100M users generating more than 300M tweets each day, Twitter users can be easily overwhelmed by the massive amount of information available and the huge number of people they can interact with. To overcome the above information overload problem, recommender systems can be introduced to help users make the appropriate selection. Researchers have began to study recommendation problems in Twitter but their works usually address individual recommendation tasks. There is so far no comprehensive survey for the realm of recommendation in Twitter to categorize the existing works as well as to identify areas that need to be further studied. The paper therefore aims to fill this gap by introducing a taxonomy of recommendation tasks in Twitter, and to use the taxonomy to describe the relevant works in recent years. The paper further presents the datasets and techniques used in these works. Finally, it proposes a few research directions for recommendation tasks in Twitter.",

                    "bibtexAbstract": "The information contained in social tagging systems is often modelled as a graph of connections between users, items and tags. Recommendation algorithms such as FolkRank, have the potential to leverage complex relationships in the data, corresponding to multiple hops in the graph. We present an in-depth analysis and evaluation of graph models for social tagging data and propose novel adaptations and extensions of FolkRank to improve tag recommendations. We highlight implicit assumptions made by the widely used folksonomy model, and propose an alternative and more accurate graph-representation of the data. Our extensions of FolkRank address the new item problem by incorporating content data into the algorithm, and significantly improve prediction results on unpruned datasets. Our adaptations address issues in the iterative weight spreading calculation that potentially hinder FolkRank's ability to leverage the deep graph as an information source. Moreover, we evaluate the benefit of considering each deeper level of the graph, and present important insights regarding the characteristics of social tagging data in general. Our results suggest that the base assumption made by conventional weight propagation methods, that closeness in the graph always implies a positive relationship, does not hold for the social tagging domain.",

                    "bibtexAbstract": "This work addresses the task of recommending relevant tags to a target object by jointly exploiting three dimensions of the problem: (i) term co-occurrence with tags pre-assigned to the target object, (ii) terms extracted from multiple textual features, and (iii) several metrics of tag relevance. In particular, we propose several new heuristic methods, which extend state-of-the-art strategies by including new metrics that try to capture how accurately a candidate term describes the object's content. We also exploit two learning-to-rank (L2R) techniques, namely RankSVM and Genetic Programming, for the task of generating ranking functions that combine multiple metrics to accurately estimate the relevance of a tag to a given object. We evaluate all proposed methods in various scenarios for three popular Web 2.0 applications, namely, LastFM, YouTube and YahooVideo. We found that our new heuristics greatly outperform the methods on which they are based, producing gains in precision of up to 181%, as well as another state-of-the-art technique, with improvements in precision of up to 40% over the best baseline in any scenario. Further improvements can also be achieved with the new L2R strategies, which have the additional advantage of being quite flexible and extensible to exploit other aspects of the tag recommendation problem.",

This results in an increasing demand for personalized environmental information, i.e., information that is tailored to citizens’ specific context and background. In this work we describe the development of an environmental information system that addresses this demand in its full complexity. Specifically, we aim at developing a system that supports submission of user generated queries related to environmental conditions. From the technical point of view, the system is tuned to discover reliable data in the web and to process these data in order to convert them into knowledge, which is stored in a dedicated repository. At run time, this information is transferred into an ontology-structured knowledge base, from which then information relevant to the specific user is deduced and communicated in the language of their preference.",

                    "bibtexAbstract": "Recommender Systems are software tools and techniques providing suggestions for items to be of use to a user. The suggestions provided are aimed at supporting their users in various decision-making processes, such as what items to buy, what music to listen, or what news to read. Recommender systems have proven to be valuable means for online users to cope with the information overload and have become one of the most powerful and popular tools in electronic commerce. Correspondingly, various techniques for recommendation generation have been proposed and during the last decade, many of them have also been successfully deployed in commercial environments.\r\nDevelopment of recommender systems is a multi-disciplinary effort which involves experts from various fields such as Artificial intelligence, Human Computer Interaction, Information Technology, Data Mining, Statistics, Adaptive User Interfaces, Decision Support Systems, Marketing, or Consumer Behavior. Recommender Systems Handbook: A Complete Guide for Research Scientists and Practitioners aims to impose a degree of order upon this diversity by presenting a coherent and unified repository of recommender systems’ major concepts, theories, methodologies, trends, challenges and applications. This is the first comprehensive book which is dedicated entirely to the field of recommender systems and covers several aspects of the major techniques. Its informative, factual pages will provide researchers, students and practitioners in industry with a comprehensive, yet concise and convenient\r\nreference source to recommender systems. The book describes in detail the classical methods, as well as extensions and novel approaches that were recently introduced. The book consists of five parts: techniques, applications and evaluation of recommender systems, interacting with recommender systems, recommender systems and communities, and advanced algorithms. The first part presents the most popular and fundamental techniques used nowadays for building recommender systems, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, data mining methods and context-aware methods. The second part starts by surveying techniques and approaches that have been used to evaluate the quality of the recommendations. Then deals with the practical aspects of designing recommender systems, it describes design and implementation consideration, setting guidelines for the selection of the more suitable algorithms. The section continues considering aspects that may affect the design and finally, it discusses methods, challenges and measures to be applied for the evaluation of the developed systems. The third part includes papers dealing with a number of issues related to the presentation, browsing, explanation and visualization of the recommendations, and techniques that make the recommendation process more structured and conversational.\r\nThe fourth part is fully dedicated to a rather new topic, which is however rooted in the core idea of a collaborative recommender, i.e., exploiting user generated content of various types to build new types and more credible recommendations. \r\nFinally the last section collects a few papers on some advanced topics, such as the exploitation of active learning principles to guide the acquisition of new knowledge, techniques suitable for making a recommender system robust against attacks of malicious users, and recommender systems that aggregate multiple types of user feedbacks and preferences to build more reliable recommendations.\r\nWe would like to thank all authors for their valuable contributions. We would like to express gratitude for all reviewers that generously gave comments on drafts or counsel otherwise.We would like to express our special thanks to Susan Lagerstrom-Fife and staff members of Springer for their kind cooperation throughout the production of this book. Finally, we wish this handbook will contribute to the growth of this subject, we wish to the novices a fruitful learning path, and to those more experts a compelling application of the ideas discussed in this handbook and a fruitful development of this challenging research area.\r\n",

Although these processes could be rather diverse, CRSs typically follow a fixed strategy, e.g., based on critiquing or on iterative query reformulation. In a previous paper, we proposed a novel recommendation model that allows conversational systems to autonomously improve a fixed strategy and eventually learn a better one using reinforcement learning techniques. This strategy is optimal for the given model of the interaction and it is adapted to the users' behaviors. In this paper we validate our approach in an online CRS by means of a user study involving several hundreds of testers. We show that the optimal strategy is different from the fixed one, and supports more effective and efficient interaction sessions.",

It engages users in a conversational dialog where users can provide feedback in the form of critiques to the sample items that were shown to them. The feedback, in turn, enables the system to refine its understanding of the user’s preferences and prediction of what the user truly wants. The system is then able to recommend products that may better stimulate the user’s interest in the next interaction cycle. In this paper, we report our extensive investigation of comparing various approaches in devising critiquing opportunities designed in these recommender systems.

Recommendation systems help users find items of interest of a particular type, such as movies or restaurants, but are still somewhat awkward to use. Our solution is to take advantage of the complementary strengths of personalized recommendation systems and dialogue systems, creating personalized aides. We present a system - the ADAPTIVE PLACE ADVISOR - that treats item selection as an interactive, conversational process, with the program inquiring about item attributes and the user responding. Individual, long-term user preferences are unobtrusively obtained in the course of normal recommendation dialogues and used to direct future conversations with the same user. We present a novel user model that influences both item search and the questions asked during a conversation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in significantly reducing the time and number of interactions required to find a satisfactory item, as compared to a control group of users interacting with a non-adaptive version of the system.",

We first describe our adaptation of traditional recommender system algorithms to meet the unique requirements presented by the domain of software commands. A user study showed that our item-based collaborative filtering algorithm generates 2.1 times as many good suggestions as existing techniques. Motivated by these positive results, we propose a design space framework and its associated algorithms to support both global and contextual recommendations. To evaluate the algorithms, we developed the CommunityCommands plug-in for AutoCAD. This plug-in enabled us to perform a 6-week user study of real-time, within-application command recommendations in actual working environments. We report and visualize command usage behaviors during the study, and discuss how the recommendations affected users behaviors. In particular, we found that the plug-in successfully exposed users to new commands, as unique commands issued significantly increased.",

Content-based recommendation systems may be used in a variety of domains ranging from recommending web pages, news articles, restaurants, television programs, and items for sale. Although the details of various systems differ, content-based recommendation systems share in common a means for describing the items that may be recommended, a means for creating a profile of the user that describes the types of items the user likes, and a means of comparing items to the user profile to determine what to re commend. The profile is often created and updated automatically in response to feedback on the desirability of items that have been presented to the user.",

                    "bibtexAbstract": "We study the case of integrating situational reasoning into a mobile service recommendation system. Since mobile Internet services are rapidly proliferating, finding and using appropriate services require profound service descriptions. As a consequence, for average mobile users it is nowadays virtually impossible to find the most appropriate service among the many offered. To overcome these difficulties, task navigation systems have been proposed to guide users towards best-fitting services. Our goal is to improve the user experience of such task navigation systems making them context-aware (i.e. to optimize service navigation by taking the user's situation into account). We propose the integration of a situational reasoning engine that applies classification-based inference to qualitative context elements, gathered from multiple sources and represented using ontologies. The extended task navigator enables the delivery of situation-aware recommendations in a proactive way. Initial experiments with the extended system indicate a considerable improvement of the navigator's usability. ",

We view the selection of destinations as an interactive, conversational process, with the advisory system inquiring about desired item characteristics and the human responding. The user model, which contains preferences regarding items, attributes, values, value combinations, and diversification, is also acquired during the conversation. The system enhances the user’s requirements with the user model and retrieves suitable items from a case-base. If the number of items found by the system is unsuitable (too high, too low) the next attribute to be constrained or relaxed is selected based on the information gain associated with the attributes. We also describe the current status of the system and future work.",

Whether for front-end user-interface changes, or backend recommendation systems and relevance algorithms, online controlled experiments are now utilized to make data-driven decisions at Amazon, Microsoft, eBay, Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Zynga, and at many other companies.  While the theory of a controlled experiment is simple, and dates back to Sir Ronald A. Fisher’s experiments at the Rothamsted Agricultural Experimental Station in England in the 1920s, the deployment and mining of online controlled experiments at scale—thousands of experiments now—has taught us many lessons.  We provide an introduction, share real examples, key learnings, cultural challenges, and humbling statistics. ",

In this paper we analyze different ways to incorporate social data and metadata from collaborative tagging systems into the graph-based ranking algorithm FolkRank to utilize it for recommending scientific articles to users of the social bookmarking system BibSonomy.

                    "bibtexAbstract": "Real-world tagging datasets have a large proportion of new/ untagged documents. Few approaches for recommending tags to a user for a document address this new item problem, concentrating instead on artificially created post-core datasets where it is guaranteed that the user as well as the document of each test post is known to the system and already has some tags assigned to it. In order to recommend tags for new documents, approaches are required which model documents not only based on the tags assigned to them in the past (if any), but also the content. In this paper we present a novel adaptation to the widely recognised FolkRank tag recommendation algorithm by including content data. We adapt the FolkRank graph to use word nodes instead of document nodes, enabling it to recommend tags for new documents based on their textual content. Our adaptations make FolkRank applicable to post-core 1 ie. the full real-world tagging datasets and address the new item problem in tag recommendation. For comparison, we also apply and evaluate the same methodology of including content on a simpler tag recommendation algorithm. This results in a less expensive recommender which suggests a combination of user related and document content related tags.\r\n\r\nIncluding content data into FolkRank shows an improvement over plain FolkRank on full tagging datasets. However, we also observe that our simpler content-aware tag recommender outperforms FolkRank with content data. Our results suggest that an optimisation of the weighting method of FolkRank is required to achieve better results.",

Recommender systems can help to suggest a user the tags he might want to use for tagging a specific item. Factorization models based on the Tucker Decomposition (TD) model have been shown to provide high quality tag recommendations outperforming other approaches like PageRank, FolkRank, collaborative filtering, etc. The problem with TD models is the cubic core tensor resulting in a cubic runtime in the factorization dimension for prediction and learning.</p> <p>In this paper, we present the factorization model PITF (Pairwise Interaction Tensor Factorization) which is a special case of the TD model with linear runtime both for learning and prediction. PITF explicitly models the pairwise interactions between users, items and tags. The model is learned with an adaption of the Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) criterion which originally has been introduced for item recommendation. Empirically, we show on real world datasets that this model outperforms TD largely in runtime and even can achieve better prediction quality. Besides our lab experiments, PITF has also won the ECML/PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 for graph-based tag recommendation.",

The collection of these annotations and the way they connect users and resources produce a rich information space for users to explore. However the size, complexity and chaotic structure of these systems hamper users as they search for information. Recommenders can assist the user by suggesting resources, tags or even other users. Previous work has demonstrated that an integrative approach which exploits all three dimensions of the data (users, resources, tags) produce superior results in tag recommendation. We extend this integrative philosophy to resource recommendation. Specifically, we propose an approach for designing weighted linear hybrid resource recommenders. Through extensive experimentation on two large real world datasets, we show that the hybrid recommenders surpass the effectiveness of their constituent components while inheriting their simplicity, computational efficiency and explanatory capacity. We further introduce the notion of information channels which describe the interaction of the three dimensions. Information channels can be used to explain the effectiveness of individual recommenders or explain the relative contribution of components in the hybrid recommender.",

The use of tags, keywords freely chosen by users for annotating resources, offers a new way for organizing and retrieving web resources that closely reflects the users' mental model and also allows the use of evolving vocabularies. However, since tags are handled in a purely syntactical way, the annotations provided by users generate a very sparse and noisy tag space that limits the effectiveness of tag-based approaches for complex tasks. Consequently, systems called tag recommenders recently emerged, with the purpose of speeding up the so-called tag convergence, providing users with the most suitable tags for the resource to be annotated.\r\nThis paper presents a tag recommender system called STaR (Social Tag Recommender), which extends the social approach presented in a previous work [14] with a content-based approach able to extract tags directly from the textual content of HTML pages.\r\nResults of experiments carried out on a large dataset gathered from Bibsonomy, show that the use of content-based techniques improves the predictive accuracy of the tag recommender.\r\n",

The result is a complex tapestry of interrelated users, resources\r\n and tags often called a folksonomy. Folksonomies present\r\n an attractive target for data mining applications such as tag recommenders.\r\n A challenge of tag recommendation remains the adaptation\r\n of traditional recommendation techniques originally designed\r\n to work with two dimensional data. To date the most successful\r\n recommenders have been graph based approaches which explicitly\r\n connects all three components of the folksonomy.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we speculate that graph based tag recommendation\r\n can be improved by coupling it with item-based collaborative\r\n filtering. We motive this hypothesis with a discussion of informational\r\n channels in folksonomies and provide a theoretical explanation\r\n of the additive potential for item-based collaborative filtering.\r\n We then provided experimental results on hybrid tag recommenders\r\n built from graph models and other techniques based on popularity,\r\n user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate that a hybrid recommender built from a graph\r\n based model and item-based collaborative filtering outperforms its\r\n constituent recommenders.  furthermore the inability of the other\r\n recommenders to improve upon the graph-based approach suggests\r\n that they offer information already included in the graph based\r\n model. These results confirm our conjecture. We provide extensive\r\n evaluation of the hybrids using data collected from three real\r\n world collaborative tagging applications.",

This paper proposes Claper, a novel academic recommendation system based on two proven principles: the Principle of Download Persistence and the Principle of Citation Approaching (we prove them based on real-world datasets). The principle of download persistence indicates that classical papers have few decreasing download frequencies since they were published. The principle of citation approaching indicates that a paper which cites a classical paper is likely to cite citations of that classical paper. Our experimental results based on large-scale real-world datasets illustrate Claper can effectively recommend classical papers of high quality to beginners and thus help them enter their research areas.",

The prior techniques placed a considerable burden on users, who were required to provide a representative bibliography or to mark passages where citations are needed. In this paper we present a system that considerably reduces this burden: a user simply inputs a query manuscript (<i>without</i> a bibliography) and our system automatically finds locations where citations are needed. We show that na&#239;ve approaches do not work well due to massive noise in the document corpus. We produce a successful approach by carefully examining the relevance between segments in a query manuscript and the representative segments extracted from a document corpus. An extensive empirical evaluation using the CiteSeerX data set shows that our approach is effective.",

We introduce a retrieval model for literature search that incorporates a wide variety of factors important to researchers, and learns the weights of each of these factors by observing citation patterns. We introduce features like topical similarity and author behavioral patterns, and combine these with features from related work like citation count and recency of publication. We present an iterative process for learning weights for these features that alternates between retrieving articles with the current retrieval model, and updating model weights by training a supervised classifier on these articles. We propose a new task for evaluating the resulting retrieval models, where the retrieval system takes only an abstract as its input and must produce as output the list of references at the end of the abstract's article. We evaluate our model on a collection of journal, conference and workshop articles from the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus. Our model achieves a mean average precision of 28.7, a 12.8 point improvement over a term similarity baseline, and a significant improvement both over models using only features from related work and over models without our iterative learning.",

Do you wish to have a recommendation system which can recommend a small number of good candidates for every place that you want to make some citations? In this paper, we present our initiative of building a context-aware citation recommendation system. High quality citation recommendation is challenging: not only should the citations recommended be relevant to the paper under composition, but also should match the local contexts of the places citations are made. Moreover, it is far from trivial to model how the topic of the whole paper and the contexts of the citation places should affect the selection and ranking of citations. To tackle the problem, we develop a context-aware approach. The core idea is to design a novel non-parametric probabilistic model which can measure the context-based relevance between a citation context and a document. Our approach can recommend citations for a context effectively. Moreover, it can recommend a set of citations for a paper with high quality. We implement a prototype system in CiteSeerX. An extensive empirical evaluation in the CiteSeerX digital library against many baselines demonstrates the effectiveness and the scalability of our approach.",

In this paper, we explore the use of collaborative filtering to recommend research papers, using the citation web between papers to create the ratings matrix. Specifically, we tested the ability of collaborative filtering to recommend citations that would be suitable additional references for a target research paper. We investigated six algorithms for selecting citations, evaluating them through offline experiments against a database of over 186,000 research papers contained in ResearchIndex. We also performed an online experiment with over 120 users to gauge user opinion of the effectiveness of the algorithms and of the utility of such recommendations for common research tasks. We found large differences in the accuracy of the algorithms in the offline experiment, especially when balanced for coverage. In the online experiment, users felt they received quality recommendations, and were enthusiastic about the idea of receiving recommendations in this domain.",

The major challenge to be tackled by our work is that given a target paper, how to effectively recommend a set of relevant papers from an existing citation network. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address the problem by incorporating various citation relations for a proper set of papers, which are more relevant but with a very limited size. The proposed method has two unique properties. Firstly, a metric called Local Relation Strength is defined to measure the dependency between cited and citing papers. Secondly, a model called Global Relation Strength is proposed to capture the relevance between two papers in the whole citation graph. We evaluate our proposed model on a real-world publication dataset and conduct an extensive comparison with the state-of-the-art baseline methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can have a promising improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques.",

Most of these systems, however, are mainly designed with the purpose of supporting the processes of planning, organizing and connecting ideas. In general, these systems help writers to formulate external visual representations of their ideas and connections of the main topics that should be addressed in the paper, sequence of the sections, etc. With the advent of the world wide web, writing and finding information for the written text has become increasingly intertwined. Consequently, it is necessary to develop systems able to support the task of finding relevant information during writing, without interfering with the writing process proper. In this paper we present the Proactive Recommender System: A propos. This system is being developed in order to support writers in the difficult task of finding appropriate relevant information during writing. We raise the question whether the tendency to interleave (re)search and writing implies a need for developing more comprehensive models of the cognitive processes involved in writing scientific and policy papers.\r\n",

On our first approach, Classic Collaborative filtering (CCF), we use Pearson correlation to calculate similarity between users and a classic adjusted ratings formula to rank the recommendations. Our second approach, Neighbor-weighted Collaborative Filtering (NwCF), incorporates the amount of raters in the ranking formula of the recommendations. A modified version of the Okapi BM25 IR model over users ’ tags is implemented on our third approach to form the user neighborhood. Our results suggest that incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms leads to an improvement of precision, and they also support that tags can be considered as an alternative to Pearson correlation to calculate the similarity between users and their neighbors in a collaborative tagging system.

Specifically, in the following, the users' social connections in consideration were groups. Unlike other studies which utilized groups inferred by data mining technologies, we used the information about the groups in which each user explicitly participated. The group activities are centered on common interests. People join a group to share and acquire information about a topic as a form of community of interest or practice. The information of this group activity may be a good source of information for the members. We tested whether adding the information from the users' own groups or group members to the traditional CF-based recommendations can improve the recommendation quality or not. The information about groups was combined with CF using a mixed hybridization strategy. We evaluated our approach in two ways, using the Citeulike data set and a real user study.",

To address these problems, we propose PubRec, a recommender that suggests closely-related references to a particular publication P tailored to a specific user U, which minimizes the time and efforts imposed on U in browsing through general recommended publications. Empirical studies conducted using data extracted from CiteULike (i) verify the efficiency of the recommendation and ranking strategies adopted by PubRec and (ii) show that PubRec significantly outperforms other baseline recommenders.",

Recommender algorithms could aid in preparing these lists, but most current algorithms do not understand how to rate the importance of a paper within the literature, which might limit their effectiveness in this domain. We explore several methods for augmenting existing collaborative and content-based filtering algorithms with measures of the influence of a paper within the web of citations. We measure influence using well-known algorithms, such as HITS and PageRank, for measuring a node's importance in a graph. Among these augmentation methods is a novel method for using importance scores to influence collaborative filtering. We present a task-centered evaluation, including both an offline analysis and a user study, of the performance of the algorithms. Results from these studies indicate that collaborative filtering outperforms content-based approaches for generating introductory reading lists.",

Tags are assigned by users to describe and find back items, but it is also tempting to describe the users in terms of the tags they assign or in terms of the tags of the items they are interested in. The tag-based profile thus obtained can be used to recommend new items. If we recommend new items by computing their similarity to the user profile or to all items seen by the user, we run into the risk of recommending only neutral items that are a bit relevant for each topic a user is interested in. In order to increase user satisfaction many recommender systems not only optimize for accuracy but also for diversity. Often it is assumed that there exists a trade-off between accuracy and diversity. In this paper we introduce topic aware recommendation algorithms. Topic aware algorithms first detect different interests in the user profile and then generate recommendations for each of these interests. We study topic aware variants of three tag based recommendation algorithms and show that each of them gives better recommendations than their base variants, both in terms of precision and recall and in terms of diversity.",

This is a grassroots approach to organize a site and help users to find the resources they are interested in. Social tagging systems are open and inherently social; features that have been proven to encourage participation. However, with the large popularity of these systems and the increasing amount of user-contributed content, information overload rapidly becomes an issue. Recommender Systems are well known applications for increasing the level of relevant content over the “noise” that continuously grows as more and more content becomes available online. In social tagging systems, however, we face new challenges. While in classic recommender systems the mode of recommendation is basically the resource, in social tagging systems there are three possible modes of recommendation: users, resources, or tags. Therefore suitable methods that properly exploit the different dimensions of social tagging systems data are needed. In this book, we survey the most recent and state-of-the-art work about a whole new generation of recommender systems built to serve social tagging systems. The book is divided into self-contained chapters covering the background material on social tagging systems and recommender systems to the more advanced techniques like the ones based on tensor factorization and graph-based models.",

Collaborative tagging systems allow users to annotate resources using freely chosen keywords, so called tags . Those tags help users in finding/retrieving resources, discovering new resources, and navigating through the system. The process of tagging resources is laborious. Therefore, most systems support their users by tag recommender components that recommend tags in a personalized way. The Discovery Challenges 2008 and 2009 of the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) tackled the problem of tag recommendations in collaborative tagging systems. Researchers were invited to test their methods in a competition on datasets from the social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy. Moreover, the 2009 challenge included an online task where the recommender systems were integrated into BibSonomy and provided recommendations in real time. In this chapter we review, evaluate and summarize the submissions to the two Discovery Challenges and thus lay the groundwork for continuing research in this area.",

Specifically, this article summarizes recent progress about tag-aware recommender systems, emphasizing on the contributions from three mainstream perspectives and approaches: network-based methods, tensor-based methods, and the topic-based methods.

                    "bibtexAbstract": "The collaborative filtering (CF) using known user ratings of items has proved to be effective for predicting user preferences in item selection. This thriving subfield of machine learning became popular in the late 1990s with the spread of online services that use recommender systems, such as Amazon, Yahoo! Music, and Netflix. CF approaches are usually designed to work on very large data sets. Therefore the scalability of the methods is crucial. In this work, we propose various scalable solutions that are validated against the Netflix Prize data set, currently the largest publicly available collection. First, we propose various matrix factorization (MF) based techniques. Second, a neighbor correction method for MF is outlined, which alloys the global perspective of MF and the localized property of neighbor based approaches efficiently. In the experimentation section, we first report on some implementation issues, and we suggest on how parameter optimization can be performed efficiently for MFs. We then show that the proposed scalable approaches compare favorably with existing ones in terms of prediction accuracy and/or required training time. Finally, we report on some experiments performed on MovieLens and Jester data sets.",

The social web has added new dimensions to the way people interact on the Internet, placing the emphasis on user-generated content. Users in social networks create photos, videos and other artifacts, collaborate with other users, socialize with their friends and share their opinions online. This outpouring of material has brought increased attention to recommender systems, as a means of managing this vast universe of content. At the same time, the diversity and complexity of the data has meant new challenges for researchers in recommendation. This article describes the nature of recommendation research in social web applications and provides some illustrative examples of current research directions and techniques. It is difficult to overstate the impact of the social web. This new breed of social applications is reshaping nearly every human activity from the way people watch movies to how they overthrow governments. Facebook allows its members to maintain friendships whether they live next door or on another continent. With Twitter, users from celebrities to ordinary folks can launch their 140 character messages out to a diverse horde of ‘‘followers.” Flickr and YouTube users upload their personal media to share with the world, while Wikipedia editors collaborate on the world’s largest encyclopedia.",

It is also a common tendency for these systems to encourage the creation of virtual networks among their users by allowing them to establish bonds of friendship and thus provide a novel and direct medium for the exchange of data.\r\n\r\nWe investigate the role of these additional relationships in developing a track recommendation system. Taking into account both the social annotation and friendships inherent in the social graph established among users, items and tags, we created a collaborative recommendation system that effectively adapts to the personal information needs of each user. We adopt the generic framework of Random Walk with Restarts in order to provide with a more natural and efficient way to represent social networks.\r\n\r\nIn this work we collected a representative enough portion of the music social network last.fm, capturing explicitly expressed bonds of friendship of the user as well as social tags. We performed a series of comparison experiments between the Random Walk with Restarts model and a user-based collaborative filtering method using the Pearson Correlation similarity. The results show that the graph model system benefits from the additional information embedded in social knowledge. In addition, the graph model outperforms the standard collaborative filtering method.",

Major research areas have focused on some of these tasks, but we identify many more opportunities. We propose a collaborative model that combines collaborative filtering and information retrieval techniques in order to assists the user to achieve these tasks. Based only on the user's tags, this personalization model assumes that a user's tags identify this user's taste. Because many users do not only tag the content that matches their taste, we propose an evaluating experiment that shows if rating information can be used to adjust the users' taste profiles. This experiment is one of the steps to advance to a completely personalized model, integrating user preference, content annotations and people relations.",

There are many potential pitfalls, including not knowing what tasks to support, generating recommendations for the wrong task, or even failing to generate any meaningful recommendations whatsoever. We posit that different recommender algorithms are better suited to certain information seeking tasks. In this work, we perform a detailed user study with over 130 users to understand these differences between recommender algorithms through an online survey of paper recommendations from the ACM Digital Library. We found that pitfalls are hard to avoid. Two of our algorithms generated 'atypical' recommendations recommendations that were unrelated to their input baskets. Users reacted accordingly, providing strong negative results for these algorithms. Results from our 'typical' algorithms show some qualitative differences, but since users were exposed to two algorithms, the results may be biased. We present a wide variety of results, teasing out differences between algorithms. Finally, we succinctly summarize our most striking results as \"Don't Look Stupid\" in front of users.",

The participants were provided with anonymized datasets from two real world online movie recommendation communities and competed against each other for obtaining the highest recommendation accuracy for each task. The datasets contained contextual features, such as mood, plot annotation, social network, and comments, normally not available in movie recommendation datasets. Over 40 teams from 20 countries participated in the challenge. Their participation was summarized by 10 papers accepted to the CAMRa workshop.",

We propose an extendable framework that can recommend tags using a combination of different personalised and collective contexts. We combine information from four contexts: (1) all the photos in the system, (2) a user's own photos, (3) the photos of a user's social contacts, and (4) the photos posted in the groups of which a user is a member. Variants of methods (1) and (2) have been proposed in previous work, but the use of (3) and (4) is novel.</p> <p>For each of the contexts we use the same probabilistic model and Borda Count based aggregation approach to generate recommendations from different contexts into a unified ranking of recommended tags. We evaluate our system using a large set of real-world data from Flickr. We show that by using personalised contexts we can significantly improve tag recommendation compared to using collective knowledge alone. We also analyse our experimental results to explore the capabilities of our system with respect to a user's social behaviour.",

Tagging is the action of connecting a relevant user-defined keyword to a document, image, or video, which helps the user to better organize and share their collections of interesting stuff. With the rapid growth of Web 2.0, tagged data is becoming more and more abundant on the social network Web sites. An interesting problem is how to automate the process of making tag recommendations to users when a new resource becomes available.</p> <p>In this article, we address the issue of tag recommendation from a machine learning perspective. From our empirical observation of two large-scale datasets, we first argue that the user-centered approach for tag recommendation is not very effective in practice. Consequently, we propose two novel document-centered approaches that are capable of making effective and efficient tag recommendations in real scenarios. The first, graph-based, method represents the tagged data in two bipartite graphs, (document, tag) and (document, word), then finds document topics by leveraging graph partitioning algorithms. The second, prototype-based, method aims at finding the most representative documents within the data collections and advocates a sparse multiclass Gaussian process classifier for efficient document classification. For both methods, tags are ranked within each topic cluster/class by a novel ranking method. Recommendations are performed by first classifying a new document into one or more topic clusters/classes, and then selecting the most relevant tags from those clusters/classes as machine-recommended tags.</p> <p>Experiments on real-world data from Del.icio.us, CiteULike, and BibSonomy examine the quality of tag recommendation as well as the efficiency of our recommendation algorithms. The results suggest that our document-centered models can substantially improve the performance of tag recommendations when compared to the user-centered methods, as well as topic models LDA and SVM classifiers.",

STS are open and inherently social; features that have been proven to encourage participation. But while STS bring new opportunities, they revive old problems, such as information overload. Recommender Systems are well known applications for increasing the level of relevant content over the  noise  that continuously grows as more and more content becomes available online. In STS however, we face new challenges. Users are interested in finding not only content, but also tags and even other users. Moreover, while traditional recommender systems usually operate over 2-way data arrays, STS data is represented as a third-order tensor or a hypergraph with hyperedges denoting (user, resource, tag) triples. In this chapter, we survey the most recent and state-of-the-art work about a whole new generation of recommender systems built to serve STS.We describe (a) novel facets of recommenders for STS, such as user, resource, and tag recommenders, (b) new approaches and algorithms for dealing with the ternary nature of STS data, and (c) recommender systems deployed in real world STS. Moreover, a concise comparison between existing works is presented, through which we identify and point out new research directions.",

Tag recommendation is an interesting and well defined research problem. However, while solving it, it is easy to forget about its practical implications. We discuss the practical aspects of tag recommendation and propose a system that successfully addresses the problem of learning in tag recommendation, without sacrificing efficiency. Learning is realized in two aspects: adaptation to newly added posts and parameter tuning. The content of each added post is used to update the resource and user profiles as well as associations between tags. Parameter tuning allows the system to automatically adjust the way tag sources (e.g., content related tags or user profile tags) are combined to match the characteristics of a specific collaborative tagging system. The evaluation on data from three collaborative tagging systems confirmed the importance of both learning methods. Finally, an architecture based on text indexing makes the system efficient enough to serve in real time collaborative tagging systems with number of posts counted in millions, given limited computing resources.",

                    "bibtexAbstract": "One of the most noticeable innovation that emerged with the advent of the Web 2.0 and the focal point of this thesis are collaborative tagging systems. They allow users to annotate arbitrary resources with freely chosen keywords, so called tags. The tags are used for navigation, finding resources, and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for the user. By now, several systems for tagging photos, web links, publication references, videos, etc. have attracted millions of users which in turn annotated countless resources. Tagging gained so much popularity that it spread into other applications like web browsers, software packet managers, and even file systems. Therefore, the relevance of the methods presented in this thesis goes beyond the Web 2.0.\r\nThe conceptual structure underlying collaborative tagging systems is called folksonomy. It can be represented as a tripartite hypergraph with user, tag, and resource nodes. Each edge of the graph expresses the fact that a user annotated a resource with a tag. This social network constitutes a lightweight conceptual structure that is not formalized, but rather implicit and thus needs to be extracted with knowledge discovery methods. In this thesis a new data mining task – the mining of all frequent tri-concepts – is presented, together with an efficient algorithm for discovering such implicit shared conceptualizations. Our approach extends the data mining task of discovering all closed itemsets to three-dimensional data structures to allow for mining folksonomies. Extending the theory of triadic Formal Concept Analysis, we provide a formal definition of the problem, and present an efficient algorithm for its solution. We show the applicability of our approach on three large real-world examples and thereby perform a conceptual clustering of two collaborative tagging systems. Finally, we introduce neighborhoods of triadic concepts as basis for a lightweight visualization of tri-lattices.\r\nThe social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy, which is currently among the three most popular systems of its kind, has been developed by our research group. Besides being a useful tool for many scientists, it provides interested researchers a basis for the evaluation and integration of their knowledge discovery methods. This thesis introduces BibSonomy as an exemplary collaborative tagging system and gives an overview of its architecture and some of its features. Furthermore, BibSonomy is used as foundation for evaluating and integrating some of the discussed approaches.\r\nCollaborative tagging systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In this thesis we evaluate and compare several recommendation algorithms on large-scale real-world datasets: an adaptation of user-based Collaborative Filtering, a graph-based recommender built on top of the FolkRank algorithm, and simple methods based on counting tag co-occurences. We show that both FolkRank and Collaborative Filtering provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Moreover, since methods based on counting tag co-occurrences are computationally cheap, and thus usually preferable for real time scenarios, we discuss simple approaches for improving the performance of such methods. We demonstrate how a simple recommender based on counting tags from users and resources can perform almost as good as the best recommender. Furthermore, we show how to integrate recommendation methods into a real tagging system, record and evaluate their performance by describing the tag recommendation framework we developed for BibSonomy. With the intention to develop, test, and evaluate recommendation algorithms and supporting cooperation with researchers, we designed the framework to be easily extensible, open for a variety of methods, and usable independent from BibSonomy. We also present an evaluation of the framework which demonstrates its power.\r\nThe folksonomy graph shows specific structural properties that explain its growth and the possibility of serendipitous exploration. Clicklogs of web search engines can be represented as a folksonomy in which queries are descriptions of clicked URLs. The resulting network structure, which we will term logsonomy is very similar to the one of folksonomies. In order to find out about its properties, we analyze the topological characteristics of the tripartite hypergraph of queries, users and bookmarks on a large folksonomy snapshot and on query logs of two large search engines. We find that all of the three datasets exhibit similar structural properties and thus conclude that the clicking behaviour of search engine users based on the displayed search results and the tagging behaviour of collaborative tagging users is driven by similar dynamics. \r\nIn this thesis we further transfer the folksonomy paradigm to the Social Semantic Desktop – a new model of computer desktop that uses Semantic Web technologies to better link information items. There we apply community support methods to the folksonomy found in the network of social semantic desktops. Thus, we connect knowledge discovery for folksonomies with semantic technologies.\r\nAlltogether, the research in this thesis is centered around collaborative tagging systems and their underlying datastructure – folksonomies – and thereby paves the way for the further dissemination of this successful knowledge management paradigm.\r\n\r\n",

Users of social tagging systems define personal classifications which can be used by other peers for browsing available resources. However, due to the absence of rules for managing the tagging process, and to the lack of predefined schemas or structures for inserting metadata and relationships among tags, current user generated classifications dop not produce sound taxonomies. This is a strong limitation which prevents an effective and informed resource sharing. For this reason researchers are modeling innovative recommender systems capable to better support tagging, browsing, and searching for new resources. This paper is a survey which discusses the role of tags in recommender systems: starting from social tagging systems, we analyze various techniques for suggesting content and we introduce the approaches exploited for proposing tags for classifying resources, considering both personalized and not-personalized recommendation.",

This is important for many websites with tagging capabilities like last.fm or delicious. In this paper, we propose a method for tag recommendation based on tensor factorization (TF). In contrast to other TF methods like higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD), our method RTF ('ranking with tensor factorization') directly optimizes the factorization model for the best personalized ranking. RTF handles missing values and learns from pairwise ranking constraints. Our optimization criterion for TF is motivated by a detailed analysis of the problem and of interpretation schemes for the observed data in tagging systems. In all, RTF directly optimizes for the actual problem using a correct interpretation of the data. We provide a gradient descent algorithm to solve our optimization problem. We also provide an improved learning and prediction method with runtime complexity analysis for RTF. The prediction runtime of RTF is independent of the number of observations and only depends on the factorization dimensions. Besides the theoretical analysis, we empirically show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art tag recommendation methods like FolkRank, PageRank and HOSVD both in quality and prediction runtime.",

                    "bibtexAbstract": "Recommender systems belong to a class of personalized information filtering technologies that aim to identify which items in a collection might be of interest to a particular user. Recommendations can be made using a variety of information sources related to both the user and the items: past user preferences, demographic information, item popularity, the metadata characteristics of the products, etc. Social bookmarking websites, with their emphasis on open collaborative information access, offer an ideal scenario for the application of recommender systems technology. They allow users to manage their favorite bookmarks online through a web interface and, in many cases, allow their users to tag the content they have added to the system with keywords. The underlying application then makes all information sharable among users. Examples of social bookmarking services include Delicious, Diigo, Furl, CiteULike, and BibSonomy.\r\nIn my Ph.D. thesis I describe the work I have done on item recommendation for social bookmarking, i.e., recommending interesting bookmarks to users based on the content they bookmarked in the past. In my experiments I distinguish between two types of information sources. The first one is usage data contained in the folksonomy, which represents the past selections and transactions of all users, i.e., who added which items, and with what tags. The second information source is the metadata describing the bookmarks or articles on a social bookmarking website, such as title, description, authorship, tags, and temporal and publication-related metadata. I compare and combine the content-based aspect with the more common usage-based approaches. I evaluate my approaches on four data sets constructed from three different social bookmarking websites: BibSonomy, CiteULike, and Delicious. In addition, I investigate different combination methods for combining different algorithms and show which of those methods can successfully improve recommendation performance.\r\nFinally, I consider two growing pains that accompany the maturation of social bookmarking websites: spam and duplicate content. I examine how widespread each of these problems are for social bookmarking and how to develop effective automatic methods for detecting such unwanted content. Finally, I investigate the influence spam and duplicate content can have on item recommendation. ",

However, most research focused on evaluation and development of appropriate methods rather than tackling the practical challenges of how to integrate recommendation methods into real tagging systems, record and evaluate their performance.\r\nIn this paper we describe the tag recommendation framework we developed for our social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy. With the intention to develop, test, and evaluate recommendation algorithms and supporting cooperation with researchers, we designed the framework to be easily extensible, open for a variety of methods, and usable independent from BibSonomy. Furthermore, this paper presents an evaluation of two exemplarily deployed recommendation methods, demonstrating the power of the framework.",

One application in which they have become particularly common is in e-commerce, where recommendation of items can often help a customer find what she is interested in and, therefore can help drive sales. Unscrupulous producers in the never-ending quest for market penetration may find it profitable to shill recommender systems by lying to the systems in order to have their products recommended more often than those of their competitors. This paper explores four open questions that may affect the effectiveness of such shilling attacks: which recommender algorithm is being used, whether the application is producing recommendations or predictions, how detectable the attacks are by the operator of the system, and what the properties are of the items being attacked. The questions are explored experimentally on a large data set of movie ratings. Taken together, the results of the paper suggest that new ways must be used to evaluate and detect shilling attacks on recommender systems.",

Explanations provide many benefits, from improving user satisfaction to helping users make better decisions. This paper introduces tagsplanations, which are explanations based on community tags. Tagsplanations have two key components: tag relevance, the degree to which a tag describes an item, and tag preference, the user's sentiment toward a tag. We develop novel algorithms for estimating tag relevance and tag preference, and we conduct a user study exploring the roles of tag relevance and tag preference in promoting effective tagsplanations. We also examine which types of tags are most useful for tagsplanations.",

However, current recommender systems are black boxes, providing no transparency into the working of the recommendation. Explanations provide that transparency, exposing the reasoning and data behind a recommendation. In this paper, we address explanation interfaces for ACF systems - how they should be implemented and why they should be implemented. To explore how, we present a model for explanations based on the user's conceptual model of the recommendation process. We then present experimental results demonstrating what components of an explanation are the most compelling. To address why, we present experimental evidence that shows that providing explanations can improve the acceptance of ACF systems. We also describe some initial explorations into measuring how explanations can improve the filtering performance of users.",

And collaborative filtering techniques have proven to be an vital component of many such recommender systems as they facilitate the generation of high-quality recom-mendations by leveraging the preferences of communities of similar users. In this paper we suggest that the traditional emphasis on user similarity may be overstated. We argue that additional factors have an important role to play in guiding recommendation. Specifically we propose that the trustworthiness of users must be an important consideration. We present two computational models of trust and show how they can be readily incorporated into standard collaborative filtering frameworks in a variety of ways. We also show how these trust models can lead to improved predictive accuracy during recommendation.",

As in heterogenous communities users typically will use different parts of such an ontology with varying intensity, customization and personalization of the ontologies is desirable. Of particular interest for supporting users during the personalization are collaborative filtering systems which can produce personal recommendations by computing the similarity between own preferences and the one of other people. In this paper we adapt a collaborative filtering recommender system to assist users in the management and evolution of their personal ontology by providing detailed suggestions of ontology changes. Such a system has been implemented in the context of Bibster, a peer-to-peer based personal bibliography management tool. Finally, we report on an experiment with the Bibster community that shows the performance improvements over non-personalized recommendations.",

These systems have succeeded in domains as diverse as movies, news articles, Web pages, and wines. The psychological literature on conformity suggests that in the course of helping people make choices, these systems probably affect users' opinions of the items. If opinions are influenced by recommendations, they might be less valuable for making recommendations for other users. Further, manipulators who seek to make the system generate artificially high or low recommendations might benefit if their efforts influence users to change the opinions they contribute to the recommender. We study two aspects of recommender system interfaces that may affect users' opinions: the rating scale and the display of predictions at the time users rate items. We find that users rate fairly consistently across rating scales. Users can be manipulated, though, tending to rate toward the prediction the system shows, whether the prediction is accurate or not. However, users can detect systems that manipulate predictions. We discuss how designers of recommender systems might react to these findings.",

Typically, folksonomies provide a rich set of structures and social relationships that can be mined for a variety of recommendation purposes. In this paper we propose a formal model to characterize users, items, and annotations in Web 2.0 environments. Our objective is to construct social recommender systems that predict the utility of items, users, or groups based on the multi-dimensional social environment of a given user. Based on this model we introduce recommendation mechanisms for content sharing frameworks. Our comprehensive evaluation shows the viability of our approach and emphasizes the key role of social meta knowledge for constructing effective recommendations in Web 2.0 applications.",

This resulted in an enormous amount of available information, products and services that also made it a challenge to find that what is really interesting to a person. Finding something really interesting is like searching for the proverbial needle in a haystack. This thesis addresses solutions to support people in finding interesting items by focusing on information systems that automatically learn and adapt their behaviour in order to support their users. The solutions provided in this thesis correspond to the three main processes in personalized information systems: selecting, structuring and presenting items.\r\n",

They have become fundamental applications in electronic commerce and information access, providing suggestions that effectively prune large information spaces so that users are directed toward those items that best meet their needs and preferences. A variety of techniques have been proposed for performing recommendation, including content-based, collaborative, knowledge-based and other techniques. To improve performance, these methods have sometimes been combined in hybrid recommenders. This paper surveys the landscape of actual and possible hybrid recommenders, and introduces a novel hybrid, EntreeC, a system that combines knowledge-based recommendation and collaborative filtering to recommend restaurants. Further, we show that semantic ratings obtained from the knowledge-based part of the system enhance the effectiveness of collaborative filtering.",

In this paper, we propose  FlexRecs, a framework that decouples the definition of a recommendation process\r\nfrom its execution and supports flexible recommendations over structured data. In FlexRecs, a recommendation approach can be\r\ndefined declaratively as a high-level parameterized workflow comprising\r\ntraditional relational operators and new operators that generate or combine recommendations. We describe a prototype flexible recommendation engine that realizes the proposed framework and we present example workflows and  experimental results that show its potential for capturing multiple, existing or novel, recommendations\r\neasily and having a flexible recommendation system that combines extensibility with reasonable performance.",

This was a bull's eye since I just started to orientate myself on a subject to investigate. I was also looking for a company where I could perform my research since I wanted to get familiar with orking in a professional environment. TNO Information and Communication Technology was one of the companies that seemed interesting to me, so I contacted Stephan Raaijmakers for more information. The subject of the proposed research project, evaluating recommender systems, was completely new to me, but seemed fascinating. And it is. In September 2008 I started my research by crafting the goals and research questions for the project. Now, almost nine months later, the research has resulted in the report that you just started reading. It marks the end of my life as a student (at least for now) and the start of my professional career at TNO. At TNO I can continue to work on personalisation and recommender systems. ",

                    "bibtexAbstract": "Recommender systems apply knowledge discovery techniques to the problem of making personalized recommendations for information, products or services during a live interaction. These systems, especially the k-nearest neighbor collaborative filtering based ones, are achieving widespread success on the Web. The tremendous growth in the amount of available information and the number of visitors to Web sites in recent years poses some key challenges for recommender systems. These are: producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of users and items and achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity. In traditional collaborative filtering systems the amount of work increases with the number of participants in the system. New recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very large-scale problems. To address these issues we have explored item-based collaborative filtering techniques. Item-based techniques first analyze the user-item matrix to identify relationships between different items, and then use these relationships to indirectly compute recommendations for users.\r\nIn this paper we analyze different item-based recommendation generation algorithms. We look into different techniques for computing item-item similarities (e.g., item-item correlation vs. cosine similarities between item vectors) and different techniques for obtaining recommendations from them (e.g., weighted sum vs. regression model). Finally, we experimentally evaluate our results and compare them to the basic k-nearest neighbor approach. Our experiments suggest that item-based algorithms provide dramatically better performance than user-based algorithms, while at the same time providing better quality than the best available user-based algorithms.",

For (1), we analyze the semantic properties of tags and the relationship between the tags and the content of the tagged page. Our analysis is based on a corpus of search keywords, contents, titles, and tags applied to several thousand popular Web pages. Among other results, we find that the more popular tags of a page tend to be the more meaningful ones. For (2), we develop a model of how the influence of tag suggestions can be measured. From a user study with over 4,000 participants, we conclude that roughly one third of the tag applications may be induced by the suggestions. Our results would be of interest for designers of social tagging systems and are a step towards understanding how to best leverage social tags for applications such as search and information extraction.",

It consists of three main components: Art Recommender, Tour Wizard, and Mobile Tour Guide. Based on the semantically enriched Rijksmuseum Amsterdam collection, we show how Semantic Web technologies can be deployed to (partially) solve three important challenges for recommender systems applied in an open Web context: (1) to deal with the complexity of various types of relationships for recommendation inferencing, where we take a content-based approach to recommend both artworks and art-history topics; (2) to cope with the typical user modeling problems, such as cold-start for first-time users, sparsity in terms of user ratings, and the efficiency of user feedback collection; and (3) to support the presentation of recommendations by combining different views like a historical timeline, museum map and faceted browser. Following a user-centered design cycle, we have performed two evaluations with users to test the effectiveness of the recommendation strategy and to compare the different ways for building an optimal user profile for efficient recommendations. The CHIP demonstrator received the Semantic Web Challenge Award (third prize) in 2007, Busan, Korea.",

Tagging allows ranking and data\r\norganization to directly utilize inputs from end users, enabling\r\nmachine processing of Web content. Since tags are created by\r\nindividual users in a free form, one important problem facing\r\ntagging is to identify most appropriate tags, while eliminating\r\nnoise and spam. For this purpose, we define a set of general\r\ncriteria for a good tagging system. These criteria include high\r\ncoverage of multiple facets to ensure good recall, least effort to\r\nreduce the cost involved in browsing, and high popularity to\r\nensure tag quality. We propose a collaborative tag suggestion\r\nalgorithm using these criteria to spot high-quality tags. The\r\nproposed algorithm employs a goodness measure for tags derived\r\nfrom collective user authorities to combat spam. The goodness\r\nmeasure is iteratively adjusted by a reward-penalty algorithm,\r\nwhich also incorporates other sources of tags, e.g., content-based\r\nauto-generated tags. Our experiments based on My Web 2.0 show\r\nthat the algorithm is effective.",

Currently, a major obstacle for evaluating recommendation algorithms is the lack of any standard, public, real-world testbed appropriate for the task. In an attempt to fill this gap, we have created REFEREE, a framework for building recommender systems using ResearchIndex--a huge online digital library of computer science research papers--so that anyone in the research community can develop, deploy, and evaluate recommender systems relatively easily and quickly. Research Index is in many ways ideal for evaluating recommender systems, especially so-called hybrid recommenders that combine information filtering and collaborative filtering techniques. The documents in the database are associated with a wealth of content information (author, title, abstract, full text) and collaborative information (user behaviors), as well as linkage information via the citation structure. Our framework supports more realistic evaluation metrics that assess user buy-in directly, rather than resorting to offline metrics like prediction accuracy that may have little to do with end user utility. The sheer scale of ResearchIndex (over 500,000 documents with thousands of user accesses per hour) will force algorithm designers to make real-world trade-offs that consider performance, not just accuracy. We present our own tradeoff decisions in building an example hybrid recommender called PD-Live. The algorithm uses content-based similarity information to select a set of documents from which to recommend, and collaborative information to rank the documents. PD-Live performs reasonably well compared to other recommenders in ResearchIndex.",

                    "bibtexAbstract": "Social (or folksonomic) tagging has become a very popular way to describe, categorise, search, discover and navigate content within Web 2.0 websites. Unlike taxonomies, which overimpose a hierarchical categorisation of content, folksonomies empower end users by enabling them to freely create and choose the categories (in this case, tags) that best describe some content. However, as tags are informally defined, continually changing, and ungoverned, social tagging has often been criticised for lowering, rather than increasing, the efficiency of searching, due to the number of synonyms, homonyms, polysemy, as well as the heterogeneity of users and the noise they introduce. In this paper, we propose Social Ranking, a method that exploits recommender system techniques to increase the efficiency of searches within Web 2.0. We measure users' similarity based on their past tag activity. We infer tags' relationships based on their association to content. We then propose a mechanism to answer a user's query that ranks (recommends) content based on the inferred semantic distance of the query to the tags associated to such content, weighted by the similarity of the querying user to the users who created those tags. A thorough evaluation conducted on the CiteULike dataset demonstrates that Social Ranking neatly improves coverage, while not compromising on accuracy.",

The complex network created by many annotations, often called a folksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, resources or even other user's profiles unbound from a rigid predefined conceptual hierarchy. However, the freedom afforded users comes at a cost: an uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag redundancy and ambiguity hindering navigation. Data mining techniques, such as clustering, provide a means to remedy these problems by identifying trends and reducing noise. Tag clusters can also be used as the basis for effective personalized recommendation assisting users in navigation. We present a personalization algorithm for recommendation in folksonomies which relies on hierarchical tag clusters. Our basic recommendation framework is independent of the clustering method, but we use a context-dependent variant of hierarchical agglomerative clustering which takes into account the user's current navigation context in cluster selection. We present extensive experimental results on two real world dataset. While the personalization algorithm is successful in both cases, our results suggest that folksonomies encompassing only one topic domain, rather than many topics, present an easier target for recommendation, perhaps because they are more focused and often less sparse. Furthermore, context dependent cluster selection, an integral step in our personalization algorithm, demonstrates more utility for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies than in single-topic folksonomies. This observation suggests that topic selection is an important strategy for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies.",

Composite services are characterized by a set of sub-services, which, in turn, can be composite or atomic. Each atomic and composite service is associated with metrics, such as cost, duration, and enjoyment ranking. The framework is based on the Composite Recommender Knowledge Base, which is composed of views, including Service Metric Views that specify services and their metrics; Recommendation Views that specify the ranking definition to balance optimality and diversity; parametric Transformers that specify how service metrics are defined in terms of metrics of its subservices; and learning sets from which the unknown parameters in the transformers are iteratively learned. Also introduced in the paper is the top-k selection criterion that, based on a vector of utility metrics, provides the balance between the optimality of individual metrics and the diversity of recommendations. To exemplify the framework, specific views are developed for a travel package recommender system.",

The suggested tags are dynamically updated with every additional tag entered/selected. We describe a new algorithm, called Hybrid, which can be applied to this problem, and show that it outperforms previous algorithms. It has only a single tunable parameter, which we found to be very robust.\r\n\r\nApart from this new algorithm and its detailed analysis, our main contributions are (i) a clean methodology which leads to conservative performance estimates, (ii) showing how classical classification algorithms can be applied to this problem, (iii) introducing a new cost measure, which captures the effort of the whole tagging process, (iv) clearly identifying, when purely local schemes (using only a user's tagging history) can or cannot be improved by global schemes (using everybody's tagging history).",

Rather than following a collaborative filtering or\r\nannotation-based approach to recommendation, we extend the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) approach and present a unified recommendation model which evolves from item user and item tag co-occurrences in parallel. The\r\ninclusion of tags reduces known collaborative filtering problems related to overfitting and allows for higher quality recommendations. Experimental results on a large snapshot of the delicious bookmarking service show the scalability\r\nof our approach and an improved recommendation quality compared to two-mode collaborative or annotation based methods.",

Our techniques are robust to perturbation in the data and tolerate some mistakes in the adversary's background knowledge. We apply our de-anonymization methodology to the Netflix Prize dataset, which contains anonymous movie ratings of 500,000 subscribers of Netflix, the world's largest online movie rental service. We demonstrate that an adversary who knows only a little bit about an individual subscriber can easily identify this subscriber's record in the dataset. Using the Internet Movie Database as the source of background knowledge, we successfully identified the Netflix records of known users, uncovering their apparent political preferences and other potentially sensitive information.",

This reduces the burden of creating explicit queries. Recommender systems do, however, suffer from cold-start problems where no initial information is available early on upon which to base recommendations. Semantic knowledge structures, such as ontologies, can provide valuable domain knowledge and user information. However, acquiring such knowledge and keeping it up to date is not a trivial task and user interests are particularly difficult to acquire and maintain. This paper investigates the synergy between a web-based research paper recommender system and an ontology containing information automatically extracted from departmental databases available on the web. The ontology is used to address the recommender systems cold-start problem. The recommender system addresses the ontology's interest-acquisition problem. An empirical evaluation of this approach is conducted and the performance of the integrated systems measured.",

This recommendation could be an on-line activity such as doing an exercise, reading posted messages on a conferencing system, or running an on-line simulation, or could be simply a web resource. These recommendation systems have been tried in e-commerce to entice purchasing of goods, but haven't been tried in e-learning. This paper suggests the use of web mining techniques to build such an agent that could recommend on-line learning activities or shortcuts in a course web site based on learners' access history to improve course material navigation as well as assist the online learning process. These techniques are considered integrated web mining as opposed to off-line web mining used by expert users to discover on-line access patterns.",

In such systems, learners can receive guidance in locating and ranking references, knowledge bits, test items, and so forth. In recommender systems, users’ ratings can be applied toward items, users, other users’ ratings, and, if allowed, raters of raters of items recursively. In this chapter, we describe an online learning system — QSIA — an active recommender system for Questions Sharing and Interactive Assignments, designed to enhance knowledge sharing among learners. First, we lay out some of the theoretical background for social, open-rating mechanisms in online learning systems. We discuss concepts such as social versus black-box recommendations and the advice of neighbors as opposed to that of friends. We argue that enabling subjective views and ratings of other users is an inevitable phase of social collaboration systems. We also argue that social recommendations are critical for the exploitation of the value associated with recommendation.",

                    "bibtexAbstract": "Personalized service is important on the Internet, especially in Web-based learning. Generally, most personalized systems consider learner preferences, interests, and browsing behaviors in providing personalized services. However, learner ability usually is neglected as an important factor in implementing personalization mechanisms. Besides, too many hyperlink structures in Web-based learning systems place a large information burden on learners. Consequently, in Web-based learning, disorientation (losing in hyperspace), cognitive overload, lack of an adaptive mechanism, and information overload are the main research issues. This study proposes a personalized e-learning system based on Item Response Theory (PEL-IRT) which considers both course material difficulty and learner ability to provide individual learning paths for learners. The item characteristic function proposed by Rasch with a single difficulty parameter is used to model the course materials. To obtain more precise estimation of learner ability, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is applied to estimate learner ability based on explicit learner feedback. Moreover, to determine an appropriate level of difficulty parameter for the course materials, this study also proposes a collaborative voting approach for adjusting course material difficulty. Experiment results show that applying Item Response Theory (IRT) to Web-based learning can achieve personalized learning and help learners to learn more effectively and efficiently.",

We describe two families of methods for transforming data\r\nto encode time order in ways amenable to of-the-shelf classication and density estimation tools. Using a decision-tree learning tool and two real-world data sets, we compare the results of these approaches to the results of\r\ncollaborative filtering without ordering information. The improvements in both predictive accuracy and in recommendation quality that we realize advocate the use of predictive\r\nalgorithms exploiting the temporal order of data.",

We explore the acquisition of user profiles by unobtrusive monitoring of browsing behaviour and application of supervised machine-learning techniques coupled with an ontological representation to extract user preferences. A multi-class approach to paper classification is used, allowing the paper topic taxonomy to be utilised during profile construction. The Quickstep recommender system is presented and two empirical studies evaluate it in a real work setting, measuring the effectiveness of using a hierarchical topic ontology compared with an extendable flat list.",

Collaborative filtering (CF) is the process of filtering or evaluating items through the opinions of other people. CF technology brings together the opinions of large interconnected communities on the web, supporting filtering of substantial quantities of data. In this chapter we introduce the core concepts of collaborative filtering, its primary uses for users of the adaptive web, the theory and practice of CF algorithms, and design decisions regarding rating systems and acquisition of ratings. We also discuss how to evaluate CF systems, and the evolution of rich interaction interfaces. We close the chapter with discussions of the challenges of privacy particular to a CF recommendation service and important open research questions in the field.",

In particular, social bookmarking systems have\r\nshifted the organization of bookmarks from an individual activity performed on\r\na personal desktop to a collective endeavor over the Web. In such a context,\r\nsuggestive tagging has proved to be helpful in consolidating the usage of tags,\r\nleading to a quick convergence to a folksonomy.\r\nIn a social bookmarking system, users' annotations can be regarded as a reliable\r\nindicator of interests and preferences. A recommender system is able to learn\r\nuser interests and preferences during the interaction in order to construct a user\r\nprofile.\r\nIn this paper, we propose a smart tag recommender able to learn from past user\r\ninteraction as well as the content of the resources to annotate. The aim of the\r\nsystem is to support users of current social bookmarking systems by providing a\r\nlist of new meaningful tags. The proposed system is based on ITem\r\nRecommender, a content-based recommender previously used in a Digital\r\nLibrary scenario.",

Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms such as user- and item-based methods are the dominant techniques applied in RS algorithms. To improve recommendation quality, metadata such as content information of items has typically been used as additional knowledge. With the increasing popularity of the collaborative tagging systems, tags could be interesting and useful information to enhance RS algorithms. Unlike attributes which are \"global\" descriptions of items, tags are \"local\" descriptions of items given by the users. To the best of our knowledge, there hasn't been any prior study on tag-aware RS. In this paper, we propose a generic method that allows tags to be incorporated to standard CF algorithms, by reducing the three-dimensional correlations to three two-dimensional correlations and then applying a fusion method to re-associate these correlations. Additionally, we investigate the effect of incorporating tags information to different CF algorithms. Empirical evaluations on three CF algorithms with real-life data set demonstrate that incorporating tags to our proposed approach provides promising and significant results.",

However, CF becomes less effective when users have multiple interests, because users have similar taste in one aspect may behave quite different in other aspects. Information got from social bookmarking websites not only tells what a user likes, but also why he or she likes it. This paper proposes a division algorithm and a CubeSVD algorithm to analysis this information, distill the interrelations between different usersâ various interests, and make better personalized recommendation based on them. Experiment reveals the superiority of our method over traditional CF methods.\r\nER  -",

                    "bibtexAbstract": "Collaborative tagging, i.e. the process of assigning metadata in the form of keywords to shared content by many users, has emerged as an important way to provide information about resources on the Web and elsewhere. Such keywords (tags) are used to enable the organization of information within personal information spaces, such as photo collections, but can also be shared, allowing browsing and searching with the help of tags attached by other users to information resources from the Web. Recent research has shown that such tag distributions stabilize over time and can be used to improve search on the Web. In this paper we are interested in another aspect, namely how they characterize the user and enable personalized recommendations. Using data from a frequently used music search portal, Last.fm, we analyze tag usage and statistics and investigate the use of tag-based user profiles in contrast to conventional user profiles based on song and track usage. We specify recommendation algorithms based on tag user profiles, and explore how collaborative filtering recommendations based on these tag profiles are different from recommendations based on song/track profiles. Finally, we describe a new search-based method, which uses tags to recommend songs interesting to a user, yielding substantially improved results. The paper finishes with a discussion of some future work to further improve tag-based search and recommendation in community web sites.",

Given a set of objects, and a set of tags applied to those objects by users, can we predict whether a given tag could/should be applied to a particular object? We investigated this question using one of the largest crawls of the social bookmarking system del.icio.us gathered to date. For URLs in del.icio.us, we predicted tags based on page text, anchor text, surrounding hosts, and other tags applied to the URL. We found an entropy-based metric which captures the generality of a particular tag and informs an analysis of how well that tag can be predicted. We also found that tag-based association rules can produce very high-precision predictions as well as giving deeper understanding into the relationships between tags. Our results have implications for both the study of tagging systems as potential information retrieval tools, and for the design of such systems.",

The suggested tags are dynamically updated with every additional tag entered/selected. We describe three algorithms which can be applied to this problem. In experiments, our best-performing method yields an improvement in precision of 10-15% over a baseline method very similar to the system currently used by Flickr. Our system is accessible at http://ltaa5.epfl.ch/flickr-tags/.\r\n\r\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on tag suggestion in a setting where (i) no full text information is available, such as for blogs, (ii) no item has been tagged by more than one person, such as for social bookmarking sites, and (iii) suggestions are dynamically updated, requiring efficient yet effective algorithms.",

Free form metadata or tags, as used in social bookmarking and folksonomies, have become more and more popular and successful. Such tags are relevant keywords associated with or assigned to a piece of information (e.g., a Web page), describing the item and enabling keyword-based classification. In this paper we propose P-TAG, a method which automatically generates personalized tags for Web pages. Upon browsing a Web page, P-TAG produces keywords relevant both to its textual content, but also to the data residing on the surfer's Desktop, thus expressing a personalized viewpoint. Empirical evaluations with several algorithms pursuing this approach showed very promising results. We are therefore very confident that such a user oriented automatic tagging approach can provide large scale personalized metadata annotations as an important step towards realizing the Semantic Web.",

Such systems are widely used to add keywords meta-data to photos, videos, or web pages (social bookmarking applications). The meta-data is then used by information retrieval mechanism to provide accurate query answers. To that end, the goal of collaborative tagging systems is to quickly discover the true ranking of a tag for an information object with respect to a given ranking criteria. In this paper, we consider the popularity rank as a ranking criteria. Many collaborative tagging systems help users tagging of an object by making suggestions based on the tagging history of an information object. The problem with\r\nmaking tag suggestions is that they may reinforce some tags and the system fails to discover the true popularity rank of a tag for a given information object. To investigate this issue, we propose and study several algorithms for ranking and suggesting tags in collaborative tagging systems where we focus on the following design objectives: (a) learn true popularity rank, (b) make relevant suggestions, and (c) learn fast. We find that simple incremental updates of the suggestion set, which besides suggestion set size require no\r\nconfiguration constants, offer good performance. Performance is evaluated by analysis and numerical results for which we used a dataset of complete tagging histories of urls that we crawled from a popular social bookmarking web service over a month period.",

In this article, we review the key decisions in evaluating collaborative filtering recommender systems: the user tasks being evaluated, the types of analysis and datasets being used, the ways in which prediction quality is measured, the evaluation of prediction attributes other than quality, and the user-based evaluation of the system as a whole. In addition to reviewing the evaluation strategies used by prior researchers, we present empirical results from the analysis of various accuracy metrics on one content domain where all the tested metrics collapsed roughly into three equivalence classes. Metrics within each equivalency class were strongly correlated, while metrics from different equivalency classes were uncorrelated.",
